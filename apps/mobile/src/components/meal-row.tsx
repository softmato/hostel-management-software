/**
 * One meal, drawn the same way on every screen that shows one.
 *
 * Four screens show a meal — the resident's home and food tabs, the guardian's
 * home, and the cook's weekly routine — and before this they showed it three
 * different ways: a `<ListRow>` with the items truncated to one line, a plain
 * icon beside a heading, and a row with the timing as trailing text. The same
 * dinner looked like a different thing depending on who was looking at it, and
 * a parent asking their child about it was reading a shorter version of the
 * answer.
 *
 * ## The items get two lines
 *
 * "Rice, dal, seasonal vegetable, chicken curry, pickle" is exactly the string a
 * one-line row cuts at the part somebody cares about. Two lines fits the
 * realistic worst case on a 320dp phone; past that it truncates, which by then
 * is a menu nobody reads to the end of anyway.
 *
 * ## The timing is a badge, not trailing text
 *
 * It is the second thing anyone looks for — "is dinner at 7 or 8" — and trailing
 * muted text at the end of a row is where it goes to be missed.

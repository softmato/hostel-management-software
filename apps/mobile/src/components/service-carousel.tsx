/**
 * A deck of services you flick through, one at a time.
 *
 * ## Why a carousel here and nowhere else in the app
 *
 * `docs/DESIGN.md` and `NOTES.md` are consistent that a menu of destinations is
 * a **grid of tiles**, never a carousel — a carousel hides most of its options
 * off-screen and makes counting them impossible, which is exactly wrong for
 * navigation. This is not navigation. Picking the trade for a maintenance
 * request is a single choice from a short mutually-exclusive list, made once,
 * where the *chosen* one wants to be large enough to carry a price and a
 * sentence. That is the one shape a deck is better at than a grid, and it is
 * what the owner's sketch asked for.
 *
 * It is still list-shaped underneath: a horizontal `ScrollView` with snapping,
 * so the platform's own scrolling, momentum and accessibility all work. Nothing
 * here reimplements a gesture.
 *
 * ## Each card is a person, and each is a different colour
 *
 * Asked for directly (2026-09-02): *"the box with vector images of doctors,
 * plumber card, colourful card, swappable"*. The drawings are inline SVG through
 * `expo-image` — see `lib/trade-art.ts` for why that and not `react-native-svg`,
 * and for the note about the palette, which this deck is the app's one
 * deliberate exception to.
 *
 * The colour is doing a job: eleven identical grey glyphs mean the label has to
 * be *read* on every card, and the whole reason for a deck is that the card
 * under your thumb is recognised without reading. Selection is still the brand
 * green ring, so nothing here competes with `--primary` for meaning.
 *
 * ## The motion
 *
 * Cards to either side sit back — smaller and dimmer — so the centre card is
 * unambiguously the selection without needing a tick on it. `interpolate` runs
 * on the UI thread off the scroll offset, so it tracks the finger rather than
 * animating after it; a `withTiming` on every card as the index changed would
 * lag behind a fast flick and read as the list fighting you.
 *
 * Snapping is `snapToInterval`, not `pagingEnabled`: the cards are narrower than
 * the screen on purpose — the neighbours have to be visible, or nothing tells
 * you the deck continues — and paging snaps to screen widths.
 *
 * ## Selection is committed on settle, not on every frame
 *
 * `onSelect` fires when the deck comes to rest on a new card, once, with a
 * selection tick. Firing per frame would refetch and re-render the confirm
 * figures dozens of times during a single flick.

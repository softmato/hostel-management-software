/**
 * The bell, and the unread count on it.
 *
 * ## Why a role's app bar has one at all
 *
 * `/notifications` is scoped to `principal.userId` with no role branch, so every
 * signed-in account already has a feed — an admin's includes the claim
 * notifications `notifyAdminsOfClaim` writes and the SOS fan-out to wardens.
 * The public home had the only bell in the app, which meant a hostel admin's
 * notifications were reachable only by leaving their own tabs. Same control,
 * same destination, now on the screens where the alerts are about.
 *
 * ## It is not the action queue
 *
 * The bell is the chronological record of what the platform sent you. The
 * decisions — verify this claim, reply to this complaint — live on the tab that
 * owns them, with the money and the evidence next to them. Two surfaces, and on
 * purpose: a notification you have read is done with, whereas a claim stays in
 * the queue until somebody decides.
 *
 * ## The badge and the screen are one request
 *
 * This used to fetch `filter=unread` for the count while `app/notifications.tsx`
 * fetched `filter=all` for the list, neither of them keyed — two requests for
 * one answer, on every tab carrying a bell. Both now read
 * `notificationQuery.feed("all")`, whose `unreadCount` is counted over the whole
 * mailbox rather than over the page it returns. `lib/notification-queries.ts`
 * has the rest of it, including why `role-tabs.tsx` warms that key on the way
 * into every portal — which is what makes this badge paint rather than count.

   * The key follows the same rule. Keyed for a signed-out shell, the empty feed
   * above would be *written* to the entry the notifications screen paints from,
   * and the first thing a reader saw after signing in would be an empty mailbox
   * being quietly revalidated. Without a key `useResource` holds it in component
   * state, which is where a placeholder belongs.
   *

   * `notification:new`, so the badge moves while the app is open without a poll.

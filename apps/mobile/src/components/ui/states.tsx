 * at a glance. A reader scanning a screen that has just replaced its content
 * needs to know *which kind of nothing* this is before reading a word, and the
 * only channel fast enough for that is shape and colour.
 *
 * Kept to one disc, one glyph, one tone: the reference apps
 * (`NOTES.md` §9) draw an illustration and a pill, and an illustration is a
 * per-state asset nobody will maintain. A tinted circle is the same signal at
 * the cost of a token.
 *
 * The tone classes are literals in a table rather than composed at the call
 * site, for the reason `<Badge>` documents — a `bg-${tone}-soft` template never
 * reaches the compiled NativeWind stylesheet.

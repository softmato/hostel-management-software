/**
 * A payment provider or bank's own logo, in a tile.
 *
 * ## Why the app has these at all now
 *
 * Three screens used to say, in their own words, that it could not: the
 * statements importer drew a green lettermark and its comment read "a brand's
 * actual logo would be better and there is nowhere in this repo to take one
 * from"; both statement screens mapped eSewa and Khalti to the *same*
 * `phone-portrait-outline` glyph, so the two wallets a resident actually uses
 * were indistinguishable on a ledger row. The owner supplied the three wallet
 * marks on 2026-09-05, and the fifty bank marks the same day.
 *
 * ## It takes a *name*, not only an enum
 *
 * `ESEWA` is an enum the server picks from. `"Everest Bank Limited"` is free
 * text an owner typed into their payment setup, and the same institution
 * arrives spelled five ways. `resolvePaymentLogoKey` does that matching and is
 * where the reasoning and the tests live; this file only holds the pictures.
 *
 * ## Every mark sits on a white tile, in both themes
 *
 * Not decoration — it is the only way these three can share a component.
 * Fonepay's wordmark sets `pay` in near-black, which vanishes on a dark card;
 * Khalti's shield is deep purple, which is nearly as bad; eSewa's disc has a
 * white letter knocked out of it and needs a light ground to read as a disc at
 * all. A fixed white tile is what every banking app does with a third party's
 * mark, and it is also what keeps `CLAUDE.md`'s palette rule true: the brand
 * colours stay inside a container that is visibly *theirs*, rather than leaking
 * onto our surfaces.
 *
 * The tile is a literal white with a hairline of black at 8%, not a token. A
 * themed `bg-card` would go dark in dark mode, which is the exact failure this
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Aspect ratio is preserved, so Fonepay is allowed to be wide
 *
 * The assets are trimmed to their ink: eSewa and Khalti are square, Fonepay is
 * a 256×78 wordmark. `contentFit="contain"` inside a square tile draws it small
 * and centred, which is correct — squashing a wordmark to fill a square is the
 * one thing a brand guideline always forbids.
 *
 * ## An unmapped provider gets a glyph, never a guess
 *
 * `BANK`, `CASH` and anything a future server adds fall through to an Ionicon in
 * the muted tone. Degrading to a *wrong* brand mark would be worse than having
 * none, and the statements screen's original note already made that argument.
 */

/**
 * One `require()` per key in `PAYMENT_LOGO_KEYS`.
 *
 * Metro resolves `require()` of an asset statically, so this cannot be built
 * from the key list at runtime — the paths have to be literals. The `Record`
 * annotation is what keeps it honest: adding a key without an asset, or an
 * asset without a key, fails the typecheck rather than shipping a blank tile.
 *
 * Which folder a key lives in is not arbitrary. `wallets/` are the three
 * gateway marks the owner supplied as files; `banks/` are the fifty extracted
 * from the licensee sheet.

/**
 * The shape of the content, pulsing, while the content loads.
 *
 * ## When to use this instead of `LoadingState`
 *
 * `LoadingState` is a centred spinner: right when the screen has nothing to
 * show and no idea what shape it will be. A skeleton is right when the layout
 * is already known — a list of invoice rows, a profile header — because it
 * keeps the page from jumping when the data lands, and a jump is what makes an
 * app feel slower than it is even when it is faster.
 *
 * Never use it for a refresh. `use-resource.ts` deliberately keeps the previous
 * data on screen while revalidating; swapping a list somebody is reading for
 * grey blocks throws away what they were reading to tell them nothing.
 *
 * ## On the UI thread
 *
 * The pulse is a Reanimated shared value, so it keeps animating while JS is
 * busy parsing the very response it is waiting for. An `Animated.loop` from
 * React Native's own API stalls exactly then — a loading indicator that freezes
 * during the load is worse than no indicator.

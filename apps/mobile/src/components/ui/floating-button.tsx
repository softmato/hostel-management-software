/**
 * A translucent pill that floats over the content.
 *
 * Used where an action has to stay reachable while the page scrolls under it —
 * the signed-out Log in call to action, and later the resident SOS button.
 *
 * Frosted rather than solid: at 82% the brand green still reads as a button and
 * as unmistakably green, while the content sliding beneath stays legible enough
 * that the page does not feel truncated. The `BlurView` behind it is what keeps
 * that readable — over plain translucency, text under the pill shows through as
 * unreadable smears rather than a soft wash.
 *
 * Positioning belongs to the caller (`<Screen floating={...}>`), which knows
 * where the system inset and the tab bar are.

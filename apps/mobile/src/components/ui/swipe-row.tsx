/**
 * A row you can pull to the left to uncover one action on its right.
 *
 * ## Why the action hides
 *
 * The roster row already spends its width on a face, a name, a room, a phone
 * number and a status — the four things that let somebody find a person. A
 * permanent call button would take a fifth column from the one row on the screen
 * that is already tightest, to serve the *second* thing an admin does with a
 * resident rather than the first. Hiding it behind a swipe is the pattern every
 * mail and messaging app on the phone already teaches, so it costs no
 * explanation, and it leaves the tap doing the obvious thing: opening the record.
 *
 * ## Only when there is something to do
 *
 * Callers must not render this around a row whose action would not work — a
 * resident with no phone number gets a plain row, not a swipe that reveals a
 * button that cannot dial. A gesture that sometimes uncovers a dead control is
 * worse than one that is sometimes absent, because the dead control is only
 * discovered after the pull.
 *
 * ## It closes itself
 *
 * `onPress` runs with the panel closing, so coming back from the dialler — or
 * from the record, if the tap went there instead — does not find a row still
 * hanging open from a gesture made a minute ago.

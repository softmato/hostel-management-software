/**
 * A subject, its figures, how far along it is, and one line of context.
 *
 * ## The shape it replaces
 *
 * The admin screens' money and occupancy blocks were a `<Card>` holding a big
 * number, a hairline, a bar, another hairline and a two-up row of small numbers
 * — correct, and read top-to-bottom like a form. What a hostel owner wants from
 * a card like this is a *glance*: the thing, its three numbers side by side so
 * they can be compared without scrolling, and a bar that says how far along it
 * is. Stacking those vertically is what made the old card take half a screen to
 * say four things.
 *
 * So the anatomy is fixed and the call site fills slots:
 *
 *     title                                   action
 *     meta
 *
 *     LABEL         LABEL          LABEL      <- stats, 2-3 equal columns
 *     value         value          value
 *
 *     [####][######][................]        <- one track, split
 *     left            ( pill )       right    <- footer
 *
 * Every region is optional except the title and the stats. A card with no
 * `segments` is a figure card; one with no `footer` simply ends at the track.
 *
 * ## The track is one bar, not three
 *
 * The reference this is modelled on draws what looks like three bars in a row.
 * They are three *parts of the same whole* — and drawing them as separate tracks
 * is how a reader ends up thinking each is its own 0-100%. Here the row is a
 * single track that has been split: each segment's width is its share of
 * `total`, and whatever is unclaimed stays as muted ground on the right. That
 * makes "we are two-thirds of the way there" readable without a legend, and it
 * makes an empty card look like an empty track rather than like three empty
 * bars.
 *
 * ## Zero and null are different, and the difference matters
 *
 * A `total` of `0` is *not* a card at 0% — it is a card with no denominator, and
 * a hostel that has billed nothing this month reading an empty red bar concludes
 * it has collected nothing, which is a different and much worse claim. That case
 * draws the muted track alone and leaves the explaining to the caller's footer,
 * exactly as `<Meter>` does. The two components agree on this on purpose.

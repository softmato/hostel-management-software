 * A row that is its own card, for a list of unrelated destinations.
 *
 * ## When this and not `<ListRow>`
 *
 * `<ListRow>` lives *inside* a `<Card>`, separated from its neighbours by a
 * hairline, and the card around it is a claim: **these rows belong together**.
 * That is right for a queue, for the fields of one object, for a settings group.
 *
 * It is wrong for a menu. Eight destinations that share nothing but a screen —
 * Finance, Rooms, Food, Reports — inside one bordered box read as one list you
 * are meant to work down in order, and the hairlines make every row look like a
 * row of a table. Separate cards say what is actually true: each of these is a
 * door, they are siblings, and you want exactly one of them.
 *
 * The gap between them is the caller's, not this component's — a list wraps
 * these in `gap-3`, and a lone card can sit anywhere without shedding a margin
 * it did not ask for.
 *
 * ## The icon is a tinted square, not a grey circle
 *
 * `<ListRow>`'s leading circle is deliberately quiet because it repeats down a
 * dense list. Here there are six or eight of them with air in between, they are
 * the fastest way to tell one door from another before reading, and a tone can
 * carry meaning the title has no room for. Squares because the tile shape is
 * what the rest of this app uses for "a thing you can open" — see `<InfoTile>`.

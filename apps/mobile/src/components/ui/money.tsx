 * How much smaller the `NPR` is than the digits it prefixes.
 *
 * Every banking app our users already have does this — see
 * `ui_inspiration_folder/app_recordings/NOTES.md` §4. The reason it matters is
 * that the currency is the one part of the string that is **the same on every
 * row**: at equal weight it is pure repetition competing with the figures, and
 * shrinking it lets a column of amounts be scanned by their digits alone.
 *
 * A ratio rather than a fixed size, because this renders at four scales from an
 * inline row to a 30-point display figure — and exported, because the painted
 * surfaces cannot use this component (its tone classes resolve to
 * `text-foreground`, which is near-black on the accent) and must not re-decide
 * the ratio. See `<PaintedAmount>`.

 * default `body` variant first — `text-base` — and a `text-2xl` appended after
 * it does not win: both rules reach the compiled stylesheet and which one lands
 * is decided by generation order, not by where it sat in the string. So the
 * digits stayed at 16 while the prefix, sized by a real `fontSize` style, scaled

/**
 * One payment claim, drawn as the thing being decided rather than as a queue row.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `<AlertCard>`
 *
 * `AlertCard` serves four queues — SOS, complaints, inquiries, claims — and the
 * shape they share is "a title, a subtitle and the buttons its kind earns".
 * That is the right shape for three of them and the wrong one for this: nothing
 * else in the app is a decision about money made against a photograph, and the
 * evidence was reachable only behind a `View proof` button, three taps and a
 * full-screen overlay away from the row it belongs to.
 *
 * The combined Alerts queue still uses `AlertCard`, and should — there the label
 * is the only thing telling four sources apart. This is the Payments tab, where
 * every card is a claim and the question is always the same one.
 *
 * ## The screenshot is on the card
 *
 * Approving is the one action on this screen that moves money, and it is
 * approved against an image of somebody else's banking app. A thumbnail on the
 * card is what makes "does this look like a payment to us at all" a glance
 * rather than a navigation, and tapping it still opens the zooming viewer,
 * because the amount on a re-compressed phone screenshot is four points tall.
 *
 * ## Failed checks are shown; passing ones are counted
 *
 * The server runs six checks and hands back all six with a sentence each. All
 * six on the card is a wall of green text that trains people to skip the two
 * lines that matter, so the card prints **every check that did not pass** and
 * collapses the rest into one line. An amber check is never an accusation —
 * `review.service` is explicit that a flag only moves a decision in front of a
 * human — which is exactly why the amber ones are the ones a human is shown.
 *
 * The sentences are the server's own, verbatim. "Claimed 12000 against 5000
 * outstanding" was written carefully and a client paraphrase of it is a client
 * opinion about somebody's rent.

/**
 * One line under the card's balance: a small-caps heading, what the money is
 * for, and the money itself.
 *
 * ## It replaced a two-up that had no amount on it
 *
 * The card used to end in two half-width facts — `Next due` and `Reference
 * code` — and the `Next due` half showed the *name* of the next charge with its
 * due date underneath and **no figure at all**. So the screen read:
 *
 * > Total outstanding **Rs 18,800** · Next due *Admission fee* · [ Pay now ]
 *
 * The headline is every open invoice added up. The button pays exactly one of
 * them. A resident whose admission fee was Rs 2,000 tapped a card that said
 * 18,800 and landed on a payment screen for 2,000, and nothing anywhere on the
 * card had told them those were different numbers. That is a correctness
 * problem wearing a layout problem's clothes.
 *
 * The line carries the amount now, on the right where money goes, directly
 * above a button that names the same figure. Two numbers on one card is fine
 * as long as the card says which is which — what is not fine is showing one of
 * them and acting on the other.
 *
 * ## Full width, not a half
 *
 * A half-width fact ellipses. `portal-shared.tsx` records what that cost the
 * admin card — `Rs 74,0…`, the figures the card exists to show being the first
 * thing lost — and a line whose left is a label and whose right is a figure
 * gives the figure a fixed cost and the label everything else, which is the
 * split a list row has used since lists existed.
 */

/**
 * The resident's statement card — what Payments leads with.
 *
 * ## Why a card, and why not Home's hero
 *
 * The Payments tab used to open with **two** bordered white cards saying
 * overlapping things: a `Total outstanding` box, and directly under it a
 * `Due next` box carrying an amount, a due date, the reference code and both
 * actions. Two money figures in the first two hundred points of a screen, one
 * of which contains the other, is a screen that makes the reader do the
 * subtraction before it will tell them what to do.
 *
 * So it is one object now. The shape is taken from `<AdminMoneyCard>` rather
 * than from `<PortalHeroCard>`, and the difference is the whole point:
 *
 * - **Home** is a full-bleed hero with the building behind it, cornered at 18
 *   and inset 14. It is the front door, so it names the app and the hostel.
 * - **Payments is a card on a page** — inset on all four sides, cornered at 22,
 *   floating with a shadow under it. A statement is an object you hold, not a
 *   surface you stand on.
 *
 * That is exactly the split the admin portal already draws between its Home and
 * its Money tab, and `portal-shared.tsx` records why it matters: five screens
 * whose top two hundred points are identical stop saying where you are.
 *
 * ## Three facts, in the order they get asked
 *
 * **What do I owe** — the painted figure. **Is any of it late** — the pill under
 * it. **What am I paying right now, and how much** — the line below the rule,
 * which is the invoice the two buttons act on and which names its own amount.
 * Nothing else. Everything the card used to carry that was not one of those
 * three has moved somewhere that answers a question somebody asked here.
 *
 * ## The reference code left the card
 *
 * It held the second half of the two-up on the argument that a bank transfer
 * carrying it settles itself while one that does not has to be matched to a
 * person by hand. That is true, and it is why the code has not gone anywhere:
 * it is a `<ReferenceStrip>` on the page directly under the buttons, one row
 * lower than it was and still above the fold.
 *
 * What it is no longer is a *peer of the money*. This card is read in about a
 * second by somebody working out what they owe, and half of it was a string
 * they need only once they are already inside their banking app. Sitting beside
 * the next charge, it was also taking the width that charge's amount needed —
 * see {@link DuesLine}.
 *
 * ## Everything on the card is on the paint
 *
 * It had a themed `bg-card` footer holding the reference code and the two
 * buttons — a white register glued to the bottom of a green one, which made a
 * single object read as two stacked cards with no gap between them. The design
 * board draws it as one painted block, with the actions on the page
 * *underneath* the card rather than inside it.
 *
 * That is the better division and not just the drawn one. The card is the
 * **statement**. The buttons are what you *do* about it, and a control sitting
 * on the page background is unambiguously a control; one sitting in a white
 * shelf welded to a card is a piece of the card.
 *
 * ## The guardian portal passes a second line
 *
 * `lines` is a list because the two portals lead with different things. A
 * resident gets one — the charge they are about to pay. A guardian, who has no
 * button to press and no reference code to quote, gets that plus `Last paid`,
 * which is the fact somebody checking up on a household is actually there for.

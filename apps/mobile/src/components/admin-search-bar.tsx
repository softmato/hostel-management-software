/**
 * A screen title with the search field built into the bar.
 *
 * ## Why the Residents tab gets its own bar
 *
 * A directory is something you look *into*, and the control that does the
 * looking should not be the third thing on the page under two rows of figures —
 * it should be the chrome. Putting the field in the bar also pins it: the list
 * scrolls under it, so on a forty-row roster the search is still there when you
 * have scrolled past the person you were looking for and want to try a name.
 *
 * This is the same shape `discovery-header.tsx` uses for the public home, for
 * the same reason, and deliberately not the same component: that one carries a
 * two-tone wordmark, an ID-card action, a map button and a filter button that
 * pushes a route, none of which mean anything here. Sharing them would give
 * this bar four props it always passes `undefined` to.
 *
 * ## It is page-coloured, not painted
 *
 * The admin group's other bars are painted; this one is not, and that is the
 * point — five tabs whose top two hundred points are identical is a failure to
 * say where you are. A field wants a page background behind it anyway: a text
 * input on a saturated ground reads as disabled.

/**
 * The field's height, in points.
 *
 * Measured as a style rather than written `h-[46px]`: NativeWind compiles its
 * class list from a build-time scan, so an arbitrary value used nowhere else is
 * absent from the stylesheet until the bundler rebuilds — the class resolves to
 * nothing and the field silently renders at its content height.

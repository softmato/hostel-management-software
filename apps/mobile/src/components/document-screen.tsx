/**
 * One screen for every prose page the platform publishes.
 *
 * Privacy, Terms, About and the Resident Offer Program are the same document on
 * the phone: a masthead, an intro, a run of icon-headed sections, and a closing
 * note. The website draws them as four page components because each has its own
 * route file and its own extra furniture; here they have neither, so four route
 * files that each say `<DocumentScreen page="terms" …/>` is the whole difference
 * between them.
 *
 * The copy is not in this file and not in those four. It comes from
 * `content.<page>` in the site config — see `lib/site-config-api.ts`. That is
 * the point of the section: the app and the website render one document, and a
 * platform owner edits it in one place.
 *
 * **Every read of the config happens here.** The route files are declarations,
 * not fetchers — one `useSiteConfig()` per screen, or the same GET goes out
 * twice on every one of these screens. Which is why `title` is a template
 * string rather than an interpolated one: `"About {siteName}"` is substituted
 * from the config this component already holds, using the same placeholder
 * vocabulary as every other line of stored copy.

 *
 * `Card`, `Badge`, `Money`, `Skeleton` and `Text` are the app's, unchanged. What
 * is here is only what a catalogue actually adds: a product tile with a
 * photograph and a price, a quantity stepper, a search field, the featured
 * banner and the department filter. Everything else on these screens — the app
 * bar, the sheets, the empty states, the list rows — is `components/ui/`.
 *
 * ## Colour
 *
 * The reference boards this was drawn from are an orange grocery app and a blue
 * fashion app. Neither colour appears here: prices, badges and the "add"
 * controls are `--primary`, and the semantic tones carry meaning only
 * (`ui_inspiration_folder/app_recordings/NOTES.md`, "take layout, never
 * colour"). The layouts *are* theirs — the two-up product grid, the horizontal
 * deals rail, the image-led cart row with a stepper on the right.

/**
 * The in-basket control on a shop card: a filled brand pill that takes the exact
 * place the `Add` button had.
 *
 * ## Not `QuantityStepper`
 *
 * That one is the cart screen's: a bordered box on a white row, sized for a
 * screen whose whole job is adjusting quantities. Dropped onto a product tile it
 * read as a stray form field — an outlined widget floating under a price, with
 * no visual tie to the button it replaced.
 *
 * This is the same *behaviour* wearing the `Add` button's clothes: same height,
 * same radius, same `--primary` fill, so a product moving in and out of the
 * basket changes what the control says and never where it sits or how big it is.
 * Grocery references do exactly this, and it is the reason the swap does not
 * make the card jump.
 *
 * ## The minus removes at the floor, and stays a minus
 *
 * Stepping to zero is how everyone expects to empty a line, and a minus that
 * simply stops responding at one is the most common complaint about this
 * control — so `onRemove` is required here, unlike on `QuantityStepper`.
 *
 * It used to turn into a **bin** at quantity one, to spell out what the next tap
 * would do. On the cart screen that reads fine; in a two-up grid it drew a row
 * of waste baskets across the shop, which is an alarming thing to hang on the
 * products somebody has just chosen. The glyph is a minus at every quantity now
 * and the behaviour is unchanged — the accessibility label still says "Remove
 * from cart", so a screen reader is told the part the icon stopped saying.
 *
 * ## Nothing here disables on `busy`
 *
 * The quantity shown is already optimistic — see `useAddToCart` — so a second
 * tap has a correct number to work from, and blocking it would put back exactly
 * the lag the optimism removed. `accessibilityState` still reports `busy`, so a
 * screen reader is told what the eye can see.

/**
 * A product as a tile, for the two-up grid.
 *
 * ## The card is four fixed bands, and that is the whole design
 *
 * Artwork, a two-line name, a price line, and a **control row that is always
 * there**. Every one of them occupies the same height on every card, so a row of
 * two tiles has its names, its prices and its buttons on the same three lines
 * whatever the products are. The earlier cut had none of that: the name grew to
 * two lines when it felt like it, the struck-through "was" price added a fourth
 * line to discounted products only, and the control appeared *below* the price
 * once the product was in the basket. Three independent reasons for one card in
 * a row to be taller than its neighbour.
 *
 * ## Adding must not resize the card
 *
 * This is the part that was actually wrong. The `+` was a 36dp square tucked
 * beside the price; tapping it swapped in a full-width stepper on a **new row**,
 * so the card grew by about 44dp, the grid re-flowed, and the tile you had just
 * touched shoved its neighbour up the screen. Adding something to a basket is
 * the most-repeated action on this screen and it was the one that made the
 * screen move.
 *
 * So the control row exists in both states and is the same height in both. `Add`
 * is a quiet brand-tinted pill; once the product is in the basket the same
 * rectangle becomes the filled stepper. Nothing above it moves, and the fill is
 * what tells you, across a grid of eight, which four are already in the cart.
 *
 * `onAdd` is optional. On the shop grid it is the whole point; on the "related"
 * rail of a product screen it is absent — a tap there should open the product,
 * and two tap targets in a 150dp tile is how people add the wrong thing — and
 * the control row goes with it, so those tiles are simply shorter, all of them
 * equally.

 *

 * of products that ignored them — tapping a tile pushed a different screen
 * entirely. So the top third of the shop was a menu, and the shop itself
 * started below the fold.
 *
 * These pills are the same departments doing a different job: they **filter the
 * grid in place**, which is what the reference board does and what makes the
 * products the subject of the screen rather than the thing under the menu. The
 * tiles are not gone — the Departments tab is still a grid of shelves, because
 * comparing departments is a real task and a rail of pills is a poor way to do
 * it.
 *
 * ## Selected is filled, not tinted
 *
 * `NOTES.md` §7: the selected chip is **filled with the accent**. That is why
 * this is not `<Chip tone="brand">` — `Chip`'s brand tone is a soft tinted pill,
 * right for a static label (a sort order, a tag) and far too quiet for the one
 * pill in a row of twelve that says which list you are currently looking at.

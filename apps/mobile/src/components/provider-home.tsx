/**
 * The parts the provider's Jobs tab is built out of.
 *
 * ## Why this portal now looks like the other four
 *
 * Jobs opened with a bare `<AppBar title="Jobs" />` — no lockup, no bell — while
 * the resident, guardian, cook and admin homes all open on
 * `<PortalBrandHeader>` over a painted account card. A tradesperson signing in
 * on a phone that also has eSewa and EBL Touch on it was the one audience the
 * app never introduced itself to, and the bell was the sharper problem: the
 * server routes `MAINTENANCE`, `PLUMBER`, `ELECTRICIAN` and `SERVICE_PROVIDER`
 * pushes to `/(provider)`, so a provider had notifications and no control in
 * any of their four tabs that opened them.
 *
 * The hero is the same object as the other four — `ebl-01`'s account card, per
 * `NOTES.md` §2 — carrying what a provider's day is actually about: how much
 * work is waiting, how much of it cannot wait, and how much they have finished.
 * It is drawn from the job list the screen already has, so the front door of
 * this portal costs no second request and has no second way to fail.
 *
 * ## No photograph, and no hostel
 *
 * `PortalHeroCard` falls back to `HeroOrnament` when `photoUrl` is null, which
 * is what this needs: a provider works for several hostels or none, so there is
 * no one building to put behind the card and no listing for the header's eye to
 * open. `PortalBrandHeader` hides that control when no `onHostelPage` is passed.

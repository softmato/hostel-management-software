/**
 * One post, ported from `apps/web/src/app/_components/community-post-card.tsx`.
 *
 * Same anatomy: avatar, author, space badge, relative time, announcement flag, an
 * options menu, the body, the media grid, then the reaction row with comment and
 * share, then the thread when opened.
 *
 * ## Comments are not fetched until the thread is opened
 *
 * The web's reasoning holds harder on a phone: a feed of twenty posts must not
 * fetch twenty comment trees nobody asked for. Fetched on first expand and kept
 * after that.
 *
 * ## All six reactions, as compact emoji
 *
 * The web renders four labelled pills and leaves `LOVE`/`SUPPORT` unoffered. Six
 * emoji at this size fit a 320dp row, and shipping four of six values the API
 * accepts is a narrowing that tends to become permanent.
 *
 * The row itself is `<ReactionBar>`, which draws each emoji with **its own**
 * count from `reactionCounts` and animates the one that was tapped. The card's
 * job is the optimistic bookkeeping behind it, below.
 *
 * ## Video is opened, not played inline
 *
 * `expo-video` is not a dependency, and a tile with a play triangle that does
 * nothing is worse than no triangle. Community media is `PUBLIC`, so the asset URL
 * opens in the OS player with no token — and the web does not autoplay either.

   *
   * `fetchQuery` files the thread under the key this card's own prefetch warms,
   * and the subscription hands it back. That also keeps two cards on one post in
   * step — a reply typed on the feed's copy appears on the permalink's without

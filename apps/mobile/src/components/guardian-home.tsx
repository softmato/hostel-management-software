/**
 * The guardian portal's front door, and the third portal to lead with the same
 * card.
 *
 * ## Why this is `<PortalHeroCard>` and not another bordered box
 *
 * Guardian Home opened with `<GuardianWardCard>` — a plain white card holding an
 * avatar, three lines and a `Call` button — under a 16-point `AppBar`. Beside
 * the admin's painted hostel hero and the resident's painted stay hero, the
 * portal a **parent** uses was the one that looked unfinished, and it is the
 * portal whose users are least forgiving of an app that looks unfinished about
 * their child.
 *
 * So it is the same object the other two lead with: the account card from
 * `ebl-01` (`NOTES.md` §2) — an identity block, a state pill, one big figure, a
 * quiet line, and a themed second register below a rule. What differs is the
 * content, which is the whole of the difference between the roles.
 *
 * ## No photograph, deliberately
 *
 * `GuardianDashboard.hostel` carries a name, a contact and a location and **no
 * photo URL**. `<PortalHeroCard>` draws `HeroOrnament` — two soft discs bled off
 * the edges — whenever `photoUrl` is null, which is exactly the fallback texture
 * this needs. Adding a photo field to the guardian payload would mean shipping
 * the building's picture to an account that is not a resident of it, for
 * decoration.
 *
 * ## The figure is conditional, and the card does not pretend otherwise
 *
 * `summary` is `null` — not a zeroed summary — when the resident has not shared
 * fees, and the whole money block is then absent rather than drawn as `NPR 0`.
 * A parent shown a zero would read "nothing is owed", which is a statement about
 * their child's rent that this app has no basis for making. Absent is the honest
 * shape, and `sharedSections` on the More tab is where a guardian finds out
 * which flags are off.

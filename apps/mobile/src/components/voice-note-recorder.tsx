/**
 * Record the problem, hear it back, do it again or throw it away.
 *
 * ## Why speaking beats typing here
 *
 * The person who can see the fault is a warden standing in front of it; the
 * person who has to understand it is a contractor reading a line somebody typed
 * one-handed. Twenty seconds of *"it is the pipe under the sink in 204, not the
 * tap, and it only drips when the pump runs"* carries what a title never will,
 * and it takes a fifth as long to produce.
 *
 * It does **not** transcribe. Nothing in the product does speech-to-text, and
 * the recording is not trying to fill in the form — the typed sentence is still
 * what the queue, the search and the provider's job list read. This is the
 * detail underneath it.
 *
 * ## Nothing is uploaded until the request is raised
 *
 * The file sits in the app's cache while it is being reviewed, and the upload
 * happens on the confirm step. Recording straight to storage would leave an
 * orphaned asset behind every time somebody re-recorded or changed their mind,
 * and there is no sweep that would ever collect them.
 *
 * That is also why re-record simply overwrites: the old file was never anywhere
 * but this phone.
 *
 * ## The cap stops the recorder, it does not warn about it
 *
 * Three minutes, enforced here rather than by asking the person to watch a
 * clock — a phone left face-down in a pocket is the case this exists for, and a
 * warning is no use to a pocket. `VOICE_NOTE_MAX_MS` explains the number.
 */

/**
 * Voice, not music.
 *
 * `RecordingPresets.HIGH_QUALITY` is 44.1 kHz stereo at 128 kbps, which for a
 * warden describing a leaking pipe is roughly sixteen times more data than the
 * words carry — a two-minute note would be about 2 MB, uploaded over a Nepali
 * mobile connection, to be listened to once on a phone speaker.
 *
 * Mono at 32 kbps and 22.05 kHz is the shape every voice-messaging app settles
 * on: speech is intelligible well below this, and the file is around 500 KB for
 * the same two minutes. The container stays `.m4a` on both platforms, which is
 * what the server's allowlist and its byte sniffer expect — see
 * `DEFAULT_AUDIO_MIME_TYPES`.

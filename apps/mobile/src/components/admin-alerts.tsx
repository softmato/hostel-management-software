/**
 * The four unprompted things, fetched **once for the whole admin group**.
 *
 * ## Why this is a provider and not four screen-level fetches
 *
 * The tabs moved from `Overview / Alerts / Residents / More` to the five that
 * mirror the portal's own groups, and that split one inbox across four
 * destinations: claims to Money, complaints to Today, inquiries to Residents,
 * SOS to a banner on Home. Four screens each calling `getAdminAlerts()` would be
 * sixteen requests for the same four lists, and — worse — a tab badge would only
 * be right on the tab you were already looking at.
 *
 * So the admin layout fetches once, holds it here, and every screen reads its
 * own slice. One `refresh` is shared: approving a claim on Money moves the badge
 * on Home in the same tick, because there is only one copy of the data.
 *
 * `useResource`'s `topics` keep it live — the socket publishes `payments`,
 * `complaints`, `inquiries` and `safety` on every server-side change, so an SOS
 * raised while the app is open lands on the banner without a pull.
 *
 * ## And once per *session*, not once per visit
 *
 * The provider unmounts when a warden leaves the group — to the public browse
 * tabs, to a hostel page, to settings — so "once for the whole admin group" used
 * to end at the group's edge, and every return counted the badges again from
 * nothing. The queue is now keyed in `lib/query-cache`, so coming back paints
 * the counts it left with and revalidates behind them.

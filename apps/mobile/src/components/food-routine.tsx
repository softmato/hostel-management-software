/**
 * The weekly food routine, drawn the way a phone can read it.
 *
 * ## Why this is a component and not two screens' worth of markup
 *
 * The resident Food tab has shown the routine as a day strip over four meal
 * cards since it was built. The public hostel page needs the same routine, from
 * the same `foodRoutine` payload, for someone deciding whether to move in — and
 * the website shows it there as a **7×4 table**, which is the right shape for
 * a 1200dp column and the wrong one for a 360dp screen. Rebuilding the resident
 * layout beside it would have been two renderers for one dataset, drifting apart
 * the way `apps/web`'s five prose pages did (see `components/info-page.tsx`).
 *
 * So the resident screen's day strip and meal card moved here, unchanged, and
 * the public page renders them with nothing in the footer slot.
 *
 * ## What the table becomes
 *
 * Every cell, in the same order, one day at a time. Nothing is dropped: the
 * website's table and this show the same 28 cells from the same array — the
 * difference is that a table asks the reader to scroll sideways through a week
 * to find tonight, and this opens on tonight.
 *
 * Day is resolved in **Nepal time**. `getDay()` on a phone left on another
 * timezone selects the wrong column for the last 5h45m of every day, which is
 * exactly the evening window when people check dinner.

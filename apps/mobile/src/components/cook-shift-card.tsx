/**
 * The kitchen's shift, as one painted card: how many plates, and what is left
 * to call.
 *
 * ## Why the cook portal gets a painted lead at all
 *
 * Today opened with a plain bordered box holding `Cooking for` / `42` / a
 * sentence, under a 16-point app bar — while the admin, resident and guardian
 * homes all opened on paint. Four portals of one product, one of which looked
 * like a different app, and it is the one used by somebody standing over a pot
 * who needs to read it at arm's length.
 *
 * ## Its shape is the money card's, not the hero's
 *
 * Inset on all four sides, cornered at 26, floating on `FLOAT_SHADOW` — the
 * `<AdminMoneyCard>` / `<ResidentDuesCard>` geometry rather than
 * `<PortalHeroCard>`'s full-bleed 18. The full-bleed hero is a *front door*: it
 * names the app and the building, and it is right for a screen you land on and
 * look around. This screen is a **worktop**. Its four announce buttons are the
 * point of the portal and they start about 240 points down; a card that bleeds
 * to the edges reads as a surface the buttons sit on rather than as one object
 * above them.
 *
 * ## The figure is the head count, and it is the right one
 *
 * It is `residentCount` — the same number the announcement fan-out notifies, so
 * a cook reading "42" and a fan-out reaching 42 people are the same fact. It is
 * not a currency, so no `<PaintedAmount>`: that component exists to draw `NPR`
 * smaller than its digits, and there is no prefix here to shrink.
 *
 * ## The two-up says what is left, never a percentage
 *
 * `2 of 4 announced` and the next meal to call. Not "50% complete" — a shift is
 * four discrete acts, and a kitchen that has done breakfast and lunch at 2pm is
 * exactly on schedule rather than half-failing. The same reasoning
 * `app/attendance.tsx` records for refusing a presence percentage.

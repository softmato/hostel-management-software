/**
 * The calendar picker — Bikram Sambat or Gregorian, for every date in the app.
 *
 * ## Why it is a component and not a block on one screen
 *
 * It used to live inside `app/manage/settings.tsx` alone, because the calendar
 * was framed as the hostel's bookkeeping choice and the owner was the only
 * person with a reason to change it. Since the preference now decides what a
 * *resident* reads on their Payments screen, and a cook on their menu, it has to
 * be reachable by all of them — so it renders in the shared `app/settings.tsx`
 * too, off the same slice, and flipping it in either place moves both.
 *
 * Duplicating the markup instead would be two pickers that drift: one of them
 * eventually grows a third option, or stops showing the worked example, and
 * which one you get depends on which door you came in.
 *
 * ## The options, and the example under each
 *
 * BS leads because it is the default. The list must not reorder itself around
 * the current choice — the row under the thumb changing meaning between visits
 * is how a settings screen gets you to pick the wrong thing.
 *
 * Only the naming half is a constant. The example beside it is *today* written
 * in that calendar, built at render by `calendarExample`, because a frozen
 * `18 Aug 2026` under "English date" is a wrong date on every other day of the
 * year — and a wrong date is the one thing a calendar picker cannot show, since
 * the reader is standing there deciding which calendar to trust.
 *
 * Radio rows rather than a `<Segmented>`: two options that each need a worked
 * example under them do not fit inside a segment, and the example is the point.
 * Same shape as the theme picker it sits beside, deliberately.

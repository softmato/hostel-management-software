/**
 * Tonight's roll call, as progress rather than as a metric grid.
 *
 * ## Its own shape, not the group's painted band
 *
 * Today's job is a *shift*: a list of things that have to be done before the
 * night is over. So this leads with how far through that shift the hostel is —
 * `34 of 40 accounted for`, with a bar — rather than with three boxed figures
 * that leave the arithmetic to the reader. It is a card on the page background
 * with a tinted head, not paint bled to the screen edges, because Today is not
 * the front door and should not look like it.
 *
 * ## Accounted for is inside **plus** marked safe
 *
 * The figure a warden is working toward is "nobody unaccounted for", and a
 * resident who has marked themselves safe from their aunt's house is accounted
 * for — they are simply not in the building. Counting only `INSIDE_HOSTEL`
 * would leave the bar permanently short on a hostel where people travel, and
 * would make the number disagree with the unverified list below it, which is
 * what the warden is actually clearing.
 *
 * ## The bar's tone comes from what is left, not from what is done
 *
 * Amber while anybody is unverified, green when nobody is. A percentage-based
 * threshold would turn green at 39 of 40, which is exactly the state somebody
 * still has to do something about.

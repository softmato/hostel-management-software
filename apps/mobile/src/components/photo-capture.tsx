/**
 * A live camera sitting in the page, with the shots taken so far under it.
 *
 * ## Why the camera is *running* rather than behind a button
 *
 * The screen this was built for is a resident reporting that something in the
 * hostel is wrong. They are already standing in front of it, phone in hand.
 * Every step between opening the screen and the picture existing — a tile that
 * says "Add photo", a system picker, a chooser between camera and gallery, a
 * confirm — is a step at which somebody decides it is not worth the bother, and
 * a complaint with no photograph is one an admin has to go and look at before
 * they can do anything about it.
 *
 * So the viewfinder is the page. Open the screen, point it, press the ring. The
 * whole interaction is one tap, and the reward — the thumbnail dropping into
 * the strip — is immediate.
 *
 * ## The gallery is still there, and it is not the headline
 *
 * Somebody photographed the broken window yesterday, or is raising the
 * complaint from their bed. The library button sits in the corner of the frame
 * rather than beside the shutter, because it is the second answer to the
 * question, not a peer of it.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It does not upload. The uris are local files and the caller decides when they
 * become assets — which for the complaint screen is on pick, so the bytes are
 * already in R2 by the time Send is pressed. Keeping that out of here is what
 * lets the same component serve a screen that wants to upload at the end.

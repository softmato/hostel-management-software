/**
 * The plan marks — the same drawing `/plans-pricing` puts on each plan card
 * (`apps/web/src/app/_components/plan-mark.tsx`), so the plan an owner bought
 * looks the same on their billing screen as it did on the page they chose it
 * from.
 *
 * One drawing in three states: a roof, and the residents under it. The roof
 * and all three rows sit at the same place in every mark — what changes is how
 * many rows are filled in, so Go, Pro and Max read as one house getting fuller.
 * Rows past the plan stay on the grid, faint, as headroom.
 *
 * ## Views, not SVG
 *
 * The web draws this as SVG on a 40×40 grid. This build has no SVG renderer,
 * and a roof plus six dots does not need one: each rafter is a rounded bar
 * rotated to the web path's pitch, and each dot is a circle, all laid out on the
 * same 40-unit grid and scaled to `size`. The coordinates below are the web
 * file's, so a change to one is a change to both.

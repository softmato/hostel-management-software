/**
 * Where a service provider application stands, drawn the same way everywhere.
 *
 * ## Why an applicant needs this on a screen they did not open for it
 *
 * A pending applicant is a `PUBLIC` account, so the app they are holding is the
 * ordinary browsing shell — hostels, community, saved. Nothing in it changed
 * when they submitted five steps of documents and a photograph of their face,
 * and the one screen that knew about their application was "Become a service
 * provider", which is the last page somebody who has *already applied* would
 * think to open. The honest reading of that app is that the application went
 * nowhere.
 *
 * So the state comes to them: a tile, the title, what happens next and how long
 * it takes. It is the same panel the website shows in place of its call to
 * action, and the copy is `lib/provider-status.ts` on both.
 *
 * ## The tile is tinted, and the tint is the state
 *
 * Amber while we are checking, red if it was refused, green once it is live.
 * Never colour alone — the title says the same thing in words, because the one
 * fact this card exists to deliver must survive a greyscale screen and a
 * colour-blind reader.

/**
 * Live progress for every upload in the app, mounted once at the root.
 *
 * ## Why the top edge
 *
 * The obvious place is the bottom, where the web puts it — but this is a root
 * overlay and the root cannot know what is under it. Half the screens in the
 * app sit inside a `<Tabs>` navigator whose bar is absolutely positioned, and
 * the rest may have a sticky footer holding the only submit button; anchoring
 * to the bottom would cover one or the other, which is exactly the unpressable
 * button the shell contract in §0 of MOBILE_APP_PHASES.md exists to prevent.
 * The top edge has one occupant, the AppBar, and covering a title for the few
 * seconds a transfer takes costs nothing.
 *
 * ## Why it survives navigation
 *
 * The upload keeps running when the screen that started it is popped —
 * `lib/uploads.ts` is a plain module and does not care — so the report has to
 * outlive the screen too. A resident who attaches a receipt and then goes back
 * to check the amount would otherwise see the progress vanish and have no way
 * to tell whether their evidence was sent.

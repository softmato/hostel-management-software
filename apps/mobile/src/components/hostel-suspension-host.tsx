/**
 * A hostel's plan suspension, over the whole app.
 *
 * `/auth/me` carries it (`hostelSuspension`), and this draws it with the app's
 * own alert card, so it reads like every other interruption here:
 *
 * - **Pre-suspension**, owner and wardens: one alert per launch with the time
 *   left, to the second. It can be acknowledged — it is a warning, not a block.
 * - **Suspended**, everyone tied to the hostel: an alert that cannot be closed.
 *   The backdrop and the back button only check again, so the ways past it are
 *   the hostel paying or signing out.
 *
 * **No pay button, no link, no QR.** The plan is business software, and Google
 * Play's payments policy bars the app from selling it or pointing at another
 * way to buy it — so the owner is sent to their email, which carries Pay now.
 *
 * The stage flips on the clock here, so an app left open over the deadline
 * blocks on time. The API refuses the hostel from the same instant on its own;
 * this is what that refusal looks like.

/**
 * The home screen's top bar: who you are, the bell, and the search field.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `<AppBar>`
 *
 * `AppBar` is a title, an optional subtitle and a slot — one row, no leading
 * avatar and no second row. This bar leads with a face and carries the search
 * field underneath it, which is the whole shape of the mockup's header. Bending
 * `AppBar` into both would give every screen in the app a set of props only this
 * one uses.
 *
 * What it does copy from `AppBar`, because both are non-negotiable on Android:
 * it extends *into* the status bar and pads its own content clear of it
 * (edge-to-edge is mandatory from RN 0.86), and it paints an explicit colour
 * from the palette rather than a `bg-*` class — this strip has nothing behind it
 * but the window, so a class that fails to resolve renders as a black band under
 * the clock.
 *
 * ## The wordmark, not a greeting
 *
 * This led with the account's face and "Welcome back, {name}" until the
 * discovery mockup replaced it with the two-tone wordmark. Two reasons it is the
 * better trade, beyond matching the design: the greeting spent the widest row on
 * the screen telling people something they already know, and the avatar had to
 * be non-pressable — this header renders in three different shells and only one
 * of them has a Profile tab, so a tap would land somewhere different depending
 * on how you got here. The Profile tab now draws that face, where tapping it
 * does the obvious thing.
 *
 * ## The chrome adapts to having an account, it does not duplicate
 *
 * Signed out there is nothing to count and no card to hold, so both actions are
 * **absent** rather than disabled — a bell that opens an empty "sign in first"
 * screen is a worse answer than no bell. The wordmark is what is left, which is
 * what the mockup draws.
 *
 * ## The ID card replaced Compare here
 *
 * Compare had a button in this header **and** a tab in `(browse)` **and** a bar
 * that appears in the browse screen the moment two hostels are ticked — three
 * ways to the same screen, one of which sat in the scarcest row in the app. It
 * kept the two that are reached with hostels already chosen, which is the only
 * state in which compare has anything to show.
 *
 * What took its place is the control the web puts in its account menu: the ID
 * card. It does what that menu does — opens the card when there is one, offers
 * to create it when there is not — because those are genuinely one intent, and a
 * button that greys itself out for everyone who has not filled the form is a
 * button that never teaches anybody what it is for.
 *
 * ## Search submits, it does not filter in place
 *
 * The field pushes `?q=` into the browse screen, which is where the results and
 * every filter live. Filtering the home screen's carousels by a query would
 * leave "Popular right now" and "Newly listed" showing the same three matches
 * under two headings that no longer mean anything. The mockup's mic is not here:
 * there is no speech recognition in this app, and a mic that does nothing is the
 * control people decide the app is broken over.
 *
 * ## The map button is the only way in that opens the *whole* catalogue
 *
 * Every other door into `/map` arrives with a hostel already chosen: the
 * distance badge on a card pushes `?slug=…&route=1`, which opens on that hostel
 * with directions running, and `/directions/[slug]` redirects to the same thing.
 * There was no way to open the map as a map — pins for everything registered, an
 * empty search field, nothing selected — which is the state somebody who wants
 * to look at an area rather than at one listing is asking for. That is this
 * button, and it is why it pushes `/map` bare: the screen's own default with no
 * `slug` is exactly that view.
 */

/**
 * The search row, and the button that lives inside it.
 *
 * Measured here rather than written as `h-16` / `h-12 w-12`, for the reason
 * every other dimension in this app is: NativeWind resolves classes at bundle
 * time, and a size nothing else uses can silently resolve to nothing. Keeping
 * the two numbers side by side also makes the proportion explicit — the button
 * is inset 7dp top and bottom, which is what keeps the row reading as one
 * control rather than a field with a square stuck on the end.
 *
 * Both came down together, from 40 in 54 with an 18dp glyph. The button at 40
 * filled three-quarters of the row's height, which is the weight a primary
 * action gets, and this row's primary action is typing. The field at 54 was
 * then the tallest thing on the screen for a single line of 16dp text — a
 * search box with more air in it than the cards below it have around their
 * prices, pushing the first hostel down for nothing.
 *
 * 46 is what a one-line field needs: 16dp of text with 15dp above and below it,
 * still a comfortable target, and eight fewer points before the content starts.
 * The button stays at the smaller of the two sizes that survive the trim — 32dp
 * is the floor for something you tap without aiming, and it keeps the field
 * visibly the taller control.

 * The three glyphs *inside* the field — search, clear, filter.

 * One number, because they are one row: sizing them apart is how a search icon
 * ends up a point bigger than the clear icon two fingers away from it for no
 * reason anybody can state. 16 sits a step under the 19 the header's round
 * actions use, which is the ranking — the bar above is chrome you press, this
 * row is a field you type in.

 * ranking for a secondary way off this screen. It follows the field down: 40
 * against a 46dp field keeps the gap the 44-against-54 pair had, and its glyph
 * is 18 in 40 — near enough the filter button's 16 in 32 that the two read as

/**
 * The map button, and the light that moves inside it.
 *
 * ## Inside the button, not around it
 *
 * A halo around the outside was the first attempt and it was the wrong shape of
 * signal: light bleeding out of a control reads as a *state* — selected, live,
 * recording — and it made a 44dp button occupy 66dp of a row that has none to
 * spare. This stays within the button's own edges: a soft band of brand colour
 * that drifts across the face and leaves, so the thing that catches the eye is
 * the same rectangle you are being asked to press.
 *
 * ## Why a gradient sweep rather than a pulse
 *
 * A button that brightens and dims on the spot is a status light, and this app
 * already uses steady colour for status. Movement across the face is the
 * vocabulary of "new here, have a look" — the same gesture as a shimmer over a
 * skeleton, slowed down by a factor of three and tinted instead of white.
 *
 * ## The numbers are the brief: slow, faint, with a rest
 *
 * `SWEEP_MS` at 2.2s is far past the ~300ms that reads as a response to
 * something you did and well into the range that reads as ambient.
 * `Easing.inOut(Easing.quad)` means it never starts or stops, it only drifts.
 * `REST_MS` is the pause between passes: without it the button flickers
 * continuously, which is a notification. And the band's own opacity rides a sine
 * over the sweep, so it fades up as it enters and away as it leaves rather than
 * appearing at one edge and vanishing at the other.
 *
 * ## Card → brandSoft → card, and never `transparent`
 *
 * The band is painted between the button's own background and the soft brand
 * tint, so its ends are invisible against the face it crosses. Fading to
 * `"transparent"` would be the obvious way to write that and is a bug on
 * Android, where it interpolates through **rgba(0,0,0,0)** — a band that darkens
 * to grey before it disappears. Two opaque colours from the palette cannot do
 * that on either platform.
 *
 * ## It respects "reduce motion"
 *
 * `useReducedMotion` is a real setting people turn on for real reasons —
 * vestibular disorders among them — and a looping animation in the header of the
 * first screen after launch is exactly what it is turned on to stop. With it on
 * the band never moves and never appears; the button is still there, still
 * labelled, still does the same thing.

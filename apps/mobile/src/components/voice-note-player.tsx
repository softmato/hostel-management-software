/**
 * Playing back a maintenance voice note, on either side of the job.
 *
 * ## Why it resolves the URL first instead of just playing the asset route
 *
 * `files/{assetId}/url` answers **302 to a presigned R2 URL**, and the bearer
 * token this app has to send is a token for *us*, not for storage. A player
 * handed the asset route follows the redirect with those headers still attached,
 * and R2 reads any `Authorization` header as SigV4 and rejects the request
 * outright — the same trap `lib/asset-viewer.ts` documents from the other side.
 * It fails as a player that spins and then does nothing, which is
 * indistinguishable from a bad recording.
 *
 * So this asks for `?format=json`, which runs exactly the same authorization and
 * hands back the resolved URL as data. The player then talks to R2 with no
 * headers of ours at all.
 *
 * ## One fetch, on mount
 *
 * A presigned URL is good for long enough that re-resolving on every press would
 * be a round trip spent on nothing. A note is played once, or twice.

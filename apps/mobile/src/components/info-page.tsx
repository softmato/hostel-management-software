/**
 * The document layout the website uses for every page that is prose rather than
 * product: Privacy, Terms, About, Contact and the Resident Offer Program.
 *
 * On the web those five pages share one shape — a centred icon tile, a title, a
 * one-line subtitle, a hairline, a short intro, then sections that are each an
 * icon, a heading and a bulleted list, closing on a bordered note card. They are
 * built by copy-pasting that shape into each page component, which is why the
 * five have drifted apart in small ways (About indents its body as paragraphs
 * rather than bullets; Contact swaps the sections for cards and an accordion).
 *
 * Here it is one set of parts, because on a phone the drift is more expensive:
 * these screens are reached from a single list in the Profile tab, one after the
 * other, and a reader moving between them sees the inconsistency directly.
 *
 * ## Why bullets and not paragraphs
 *
 * The web renders each section's `content` array as `<li>`s with a dot. That is
 * not decoration — the copy is written as discrete claims ("Passwords are hashed
 * and salted", "One reading per day is retained") and running them together into
 * a paragraph makes a legal document that has to be read twice. Same list, same
 * dot, same order.

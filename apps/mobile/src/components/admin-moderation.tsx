/**
 * What a hostel's staff can do to their own community space, on a phone.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * The admin group had a Community tab from the day Community got a tab in every
 * role, and it rendered `<CommunityBoard />` — the resident's feed, unchanged.
 * So an admin could read and post like anybody else and could do nothing about
 * a reported post, while the portal has carried a moderation queue the whole
 * time (`community-moderation-panel.tsx`, reading the same service this does).
 * A tab that spends a fifth of the bar showing an admin the member view of a
 * screen they are supposed to police is worse than no tab.
 *
 * ## The queue is a *decision* list, not a feed
 *
 * Every card here ends in a verdict, which is the whole difference from the
 * board next door: no reactions, no comment thread, no share. Two buttons, and
 * both of them write an audit entry.

/**
 * How many posts are waiting on somebody, for the entry point that opens them.
 *
 * Fetched with `filter=flagged` and read off `summary`, not off `posts.length`:
 * the summary counts the whole queue while the list is one page, so a hostel
 * with thirty reported posts would otherwise badge the first page's twenty.
 *
 * Tolerant by construction — `useResource` holds the error and this returns
 * null for it, so a moderation route that is down or refused costs the Community
 * tab a badge rather than a screen. Null and zero are deliberately different:
 * null hides the control, zero shows it unbadged.

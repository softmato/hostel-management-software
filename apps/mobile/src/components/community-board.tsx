/**
 * The community feed.
 *
 * Ported from `apps/web/src/app/_components/community-page.tsx`, which is a
 * three-column layout: a spaces rail, the feed, and a sponsor rail. On a phone the
 * rail's space buttons become a horizontal chip row in the same order, the search
 * and new/top controls keep their place above the feed, and the composer sits where
 * the web's does — between the controls and the first post.
 *
 * **Not ported:** the sponsor rail, popular hostels, trending tags and the
 * guidelines card. All four are sidebar furniture served by `/community/sidebar`,
 * and none is in this milestone's checklist. Noted in `docs/MOBILE_APP_PHASES.md`
 * rather than silently dropped.
 *
 * ## Infinite scroll rather than a pager
 *
 * `useResource` holds one payload and has no notion of pages, so the feed keeps its
 * own list and appends. Page 1 replaces, later pages append, and a space/sort/search
 * change resets to page 1 — which is why the effect below keys off all three.
 *
 * ## Reading needs no account
 *
 * `GET /community` uses `loadApiPrincipal`, so this screen works signed out. What
 * changes is `spaces.viewer.canPost`: the composer is replaced by a sign-in line,
 * and reactions, comments and votes say so when tapped rather than being hidden.
 *
 * ## Why this is a component and not just a screen
 *
 * Two routes render it, for the same reason `public-home.tsx` is shared: it is a
 * **tab** in the `(browse)` shell a signed-in `PUBLIC_USER` gets, and a pushed
 * screen everywhere else — the role `more.tsx` menus and the `/community/[postId]`
 * share link both reach it that way. They differ in two things only, the back
 * button and the tab bar's reserved height, so both are props rather than a
 * second copy of a 500-line feed.
 *
 * ## What the redesign changed, and what it could not
 *
 * The header, the chip row, the sort strip and the composer follow the mockup:
 * a titled bar with the bell, one search pill, an All / own-hostel chip pair,
 * an underlined sort strip, and a composer that leads with the viewer's own face.
 * Posts sit flat on the page between hairlines — no card boxes.
 *
 * Two things in the mockup are **not** here, because nothing behind them exists:
 *
 * - **A "For you" sort.** `communityFeedQuerySchema` is
 *   `sort: z.enum(["new", "top"])`. A third tab would either repeat one of those
 *   under a name that promises personalisation, or send a value the server
 *   rejects. The strip therefore has the two sorts that are real.
 * - **A share count.** Nothing counts shares — `Share.share` hands off to the OS
 *   and the OS does not report back — so the share control is a label, not a
 *   number.

/**
 * The composer.

 * to: a public post is read by people who are neither the asset's owner nor in the
 * author's hostel, and the file route default-denies exactly that.
 *
 * The picker is images-only. `expo-video` is not a dependency, so a video could be
 * posted and then not played by anyone on this client — and a post nobody on the
 * phone can watch is not a feature. Existing videos in the feed open in the OS
 * player.
 *
 * **There is no anonymous toggle.** `communityPostCreateSchema` is
 * `{ body, visibility, media }` — no `isAnonymous` field exists on the schema or
 * the model, so the control would be a lie.
 *
 * ## The mockup's shape: a face, a line, and one row of controls
 *
 * This was a stacked form — textarea, then a row, then an audience line, then a
 * members-only checkbox — four rows deep before the first post in the feed. The
 * mockup collapses it: the viewer's avatar beside a single-line field, and one
 * footer row holding Photo, the audience, and Post.
 *
 * The audience stopped being a checkbox in that move and became the thing it
 * always was: a **choice of where this lands**, phrased as the destination
 * rather than as a restriction. "Members only" ticked and unticked is the same
 * two options as "Public" and "Green View", except the checkbox only makes sense
 * to somebody who already knows what it would otherwise default to.
 *
 * A public-space author still gets no chevron. `createCommunityPost` forces
 * `PUBLIC` for them because there is no narrower room to fall back to, so the
 * line states where the post is going and does not pretend to ask.
 *
 * No box around it: the field is a filled pill and a hairline below separates
 * the composer from the first post, the same divider the posts use.

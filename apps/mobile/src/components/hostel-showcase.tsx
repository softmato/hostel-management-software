/**
 * The top of the home screen: real listings, sliding on their own.
 *
 * ## What this replaced, and why
 *
 * A full-width green card with a headline, a search field and three trust chips
 * — an older mockup's hero. It filled the first screenful with copy nobody reads and
 * one photo, on a screen whose entire job is showing hostels. This puts the
 * hostels there instead, at the size a photo is actually worth looking at, and
 * the search field moved up into the header where it is reachable without
 * scrolling.
 *
 * ## Auto-advance, and how it stops
 *
 * It slides every few seconds and then **yields to the user permanently**: the
 * first drag cancels the timer for the life of the screen. A carousel that
 * resumes after a delay takes the card away from under the thumb of the person
 * reading it, which is the one thing an auto-slider must not do — and "resume
 * after N seconds" is a race with how long someone spends reading.
 *
 * Three other things switch it off, all for the same underlying reason — an
 * animation nobody is watching is a battery and a vestibular problem, not a
 * feature:
 *
 * - **Reduce Motion.** Honoured, and re-read live: this is an unprompted,
 *   repeating, horizontal movement, which is exactly what the setting exists for.
 * - **Blur.** `useFocusEffect` stops the timer when the screen is not on top, so
 *   a phone left on the notifications screen is not animating a list behind it.
 * - **One card.** Nothing to advance to; the dots are hidden too.
 *
 * ## Widths are measured, not assumed
 *
 * The card width comes from `useWindowDimensions`, so it follows a rotation and
 * a foldable rather than baking in a phone-sized constant. `snapToInterval` does
 * the paging instead of `pagingEnabled`, because a gap between cards means one
 * page is *not* one screen width and `pagingEnabled` would drift a little
 * further out of alignment on every swipe.

/** `Screen`'s `px-5` on both sides — the card is inset, not full-bleed. */
const PAGE_INSET = 40;
/**
 * The card is a **split**: photograph on the left, the details column on the
 * right, both running the full height. That is the mockup's shape, and it is
 * what lets one card carry the price, the rating, three facilities and a call
 * to action without becoming a screenful.
 *
 * ## The two numbers below are the whole shape of the card
 *
 * The mockup's card is **short and wide**, with a nearly square photograph. This
 * shipped at `0.42 × 268`, which on a 360dp handset is a 134×268 photo — a tall
 * strip, twice as high as it is wide, on a card half again as deep as the design
 * draws it. Both numbers moved together, because either one alone makes it
 * worse: a shorter card with a 42% photo is a *thinner* strip, and a wider photo
 * on a 268 card is a taller one.
 *
 * The photo stops at 44% rather than going to the mockup's half, and the number
 * is the reason. On a 360dp handset an even split leaves about 130dp of text
 * column, and `NPR 10,000 – 18,000 /month` needs about 155 at the sizes below —
 * so the price, the one string on the card people are actually reading, either
 * came out as `NPR 10,000 – 1…` or dropped its `/month` onto a line of its own,
 * which is the shape a price should never have. 44%, an 8dp column padding and
 * a point off both type sizes are what fit the whole thing on one line; the row
 * still wraps rather than truncates if a longer range ever does not.
 *
 * The height is what the contents need and no more: name, place, rating, price
 * and facilities are ~100dp stacked once they come off the variant table, the
 * View Details bar is 36, and the rest is padding. It came down with the type
 * rather than by squeezing: the numbers are what the mockup's short, wide card
 * costs, and cutting further starts clipping the bar at large system font sizes.

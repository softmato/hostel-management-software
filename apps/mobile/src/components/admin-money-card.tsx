/**
 * The month's collections, as a card object rather than as a painted band.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `AdminBanner`
 *
 * It was, and every admin tab then opened with the same full-bleed coloured
 * strip under the same painted bar — five screens whose top 200 points were
 * indistinguishable, which is a worse problem than the flat boxes it replaced.
 * Sameness at the top of a screen is not consistency, it is a failure to say
 * where you are.
 *
 * So the paint stays and the *shape* changes. Home's is a full-bleed hero with
 * the building behind it, because Home is the front door. This is a card —
 * inset from the page edge on all four sides, floating on the page background
 * with a shadow under it — because Money is a statement, and a statement is an
 * object you hold rather than a surface you stand on. They share their colours
 * and share nothing else.
 *
 * ## The meter is the whole reason this is not three numbers
 *
 * `NPR 74,000 of NPR 98,000` is two figures and a subtraction. The bar is the
 * answer the subtraction was for, and it is legible at arm's length. Its own
 * track is drawn here rather than reusing `<Meter>`: that component's tones are
 * palette colours for a themed surface, and `bg-destructive` on a teal card is
 * a red smear rather than a warning.

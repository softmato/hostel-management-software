/**
 * The domain topics the server publishes on `resource:changed`.
 *
 * Mirrors `REALTIME_TOPIC` in `apps/web/src/lib/realtime/channels.ts`. Kept as
 * its own tiny module rather than living in `lib/realtime.ts` because that file
 * `require`s `pusher-js/react-native`, which reaches React Native — and Vitest
 * here is node-side with no RN shim, so `lib/resource-bus.ts` could not be
 * tested if it imported its topic list from there.
 *
 * Mobile does not carry the web's `TOPIC_ENDPOINTS` table. That table exists to
 * turn a topic into query-cache keys; on mobile a screen names its own topics
 * and re-runs the loader it already holds, so there is nothing to map.

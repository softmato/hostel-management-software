 * The hostel admin Home hero, as gradient stops.

 * JS-only by construction — `LinearGradient` takes an array of colour *values*,
 * not a class — so this is the one token with no `global.css` twin, and both
 * schemes therefore have to live here or dark mode gets a light-mode header.
 *
 * ## It is the brand green now, top to bottom
 *
 * It used to run cyan → teal, and the long note that lived here was entirely
 * about managing the hue shift that travel caused: over a hostel's photograph
 * the building came out blue at the top and green at the bottom. Both stops are
 * now the same hue at two depths, so there is no hue to shift and the ramp only
 * carries light — which is what a gradient on a card should be doing anyway.
 *
 * The pair is deliberately shallow. `#0a8a4b` is the brand, `#046b48` is the
 * same green with the lights down; far enough apart for the hero to read as an
 * object with a top and a bottom, near enough that the journey is never the
 * loudest thing on the screen.
 *
 * The dark pair is not this rotated darker but a genuinely deep version: white
 * numerals have to stay the brightest thing on the card, and full-strength
 * `#12a95d` behind them is close to competing.

 * Role → route group. Mirrors `packages/shared/src/types/roles.ts`.

 * There is no `SERVICE_PROVIDER` role: a provider is a `PUBLIC` account with an
 * APPROVED `ServiceProvider` record behind it (PHASES.md §6.1, superseded note).
 * So the provider surface is decided from `/auth/me`'s provider flag, not from
 * `role` — which is why `resolveHome` takes the whole account, not just a role.

/**
 * The single decision the splash gate makes. Pure and synchronous on purpose —
 * it runs before the first frame, from a cached account, with no network.
 *
 * **Signed out goes to the public app, not to login.** The mobile app is the
 * website: someone who has not signed in can still browse hostels, compare them
 * and send an inquiry, exactly as they can on the web. Login is a destination
 * reached from a button, not a wall in front of the product — a hostel-hunting
 * student has no account yet and nothing to sign in with, and a login form is
 * the fastest way to lose them.
 *
 * **And it goes to the same place a signed-in browser does.** There used to be a
 * second group, `(public)`: the identical discovery screens in a plain stack
 * with a floating Log in pill instead of tabs. Two groups meant two copies of
 * every navigation decision, a pill hovering over the home screen of someone who
 * had nothing to sign in with, and a Compare tab that existed or did not depending
 * on whether you had an account — for screens that read the same public API
 * either way.
 *
 * Now the shell is one shell. `(browse)` renders for everyone who is not routed
 * to a role dashboard, and the only thing a session changes is the card at the
 * top of the Profile tab: your account, or an invitation to make one. Every
 * other audience — resident, guardian, cook, admin, provider — still goes
 * straight to its own tabs, which is what this function is for.
 *
 * **A session always reaches its role's home.** There used to be one exception:
 * an account flagged `mustChangePassword` — a cook or warden holding the
 * temporary password its admin issued — was sent to a set-password screen
 * before its own group, on every launch. It is gone, along with the screen. A
 * provisioned account signs in with the username and password its warden gave
 * it and goes to work; anyone who wants a password of their own takes the
 * ordinary route through Forgot password, off their own mailbox. The flag still
 * exists server-side and the platform admin list still shows which accounts
 * hold an initial password — it just no longer decides where anybody lands,
 * which is what made a Google sign-in on an admin's account open a password
 * form instead of their dashboard.

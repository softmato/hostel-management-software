/**
 * The ward's dues, read-only — which is the server's shape, not a limitation
 * of this screen.
 *
 * `/guardian/payments` is a GET and there is no guardian-side payment or claim
 * route anywhere in `apps/web`. The web dashboard drew a "Make a Payment"
 * button anyway, with no handler behind it, so a parent tapping it to settle
 * their child's rent got silence. This screen says what to do instead.
 *
 * Receipts arrive as their own list keyed by billing month, so they join the
 * dues rows without a second request — and are gated by their *own* flag, which
 * is why a row can legitimately show dues with no receipt number beside it.
 *
 * ## It leads with the resident tab's card, without its lower register
 *
 * `<ResidentDuesCard>` is the painted statement object the resident's Payments
 * tab leads with: the balance on the paint, an overdue-or-settled pill, and a
 * two-up of `Next due` / `Last paid`. Everything on it is a *reading*, which is
 * exactly what a guardian is entitled to — so it is reused whole, and the
 * `footer` is simply not passed.
 *
 * That absence is the design. The register carries the reference code and the
 * `Pay now` / `I've paid` buttons, and a guardian has neither: the code is the
 * resident's to quote and there is no route behind either button. A card that
 * silently loses its action half between two roles is a much better statement of
 * "you can watch this, you cannot act on it" than a disabled button would be —
 * and the sentence under the card says it in words as well, because a parent
 * should not have to infer a permission from a missing control.
 *
 * The bordered `Total outstanding` box it replaced said the same figure in the
 * plainest possible way while the resident's own screen, one account away, said
 * it on paint. Two people looking at one debt should be looking at one object.

/**
 * Night status, the promise that comes with it, and how to reach the office.
 *
 * ## Two things this screen deliberately does not show
 *
 * **A time.** `safety.asOf` is a date because the serializer truncates it —
 * PHASES.md §4.1 treats the exact minute a resident was checked as
 * surveillance, not reassurance. The web page rendered `new Date(...)
 * .toLocaleString()` off a field that did not exist and printed "Invalid Date";
 * neither the bug nor the intent survives here.
 *
 * **An all-clear.** The web drew an "Emergency Status: Normal — no active
 * alerts" tile, and the guardian payload contains no SOS field of any kind, so
 * it printed "Normal" whether or not an alert was live. Telling a parent there
 * is no emergency without having asked is the one thing this screen must never
 * do, so the tile is gone rather than reworded.
 *
 * ## Notices moved to Home
 *
 * This screen used to end with a "Guardian-visible notices" section, under the
 * night status and the hostel's phone number. A notice is not a safety record —
 * it is the hostel talking to the household — and putting it here meant Home,
 * Safety and this tab all listed the same rows. Home keeps them now; this screen
 * is night status, the promise, the office, and what the ward has open with the
 * hostel, which is one subject.
 *
 * ## One contact card, not the web's two (§5.2)
 *
 * The web has a "Warden / Hostel In-charge" section and a "Hostel Emergency
 * Contact" section, and both render the **same** `hostel.contact.phone` — there
 * is no warden field in the guardian payload. Two cards offering one number
 * reads as two escalation routes and is one, so this screen keeps a single card
 * and adds the address and email the payload also carries.

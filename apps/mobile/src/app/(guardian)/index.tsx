/**
 * A guardian's home: their ward, and only what the resident chose to share.
 *
 * ## It had become a longer copy of the two tabs beside it
 *
 * This screen drew the night status, the outstanding figure, a metric strip,
 * today's meals, the notices, the complaint list **and** a row into Payments.
 * The Safety tab drew night status, complaints and notices; the Payments tab
 * drew the outstanding figure, the dues and the receipts. So a guardian with
 * everything shared read the same four sections three times, and Home — whose
 * job is to say where to go — was the longest scroll in the portal.
 *
 * That is the failure the admin and resident homes were rebuilt to fix, and the
 * fix is the same one: **a home screen keeps what lives nowhere else, and points
 * at the rest.**
 *
 * | | |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | **The hero** | who, where, tonight's word, what is owed — and the office's number in its second register |
 * | **Today's meals** | Food is not a tab in this portal, so this is the one place it exists |
 * | **From the hostel** | the guardian-visible notices, moved off the Safety tab where they never belonged |
 * | **Two doors** | Safety and Payments, subtitled with the fact that would otherwise have been a whole section |
 *
 * The metric strip went with the duplication. `Due` repeated the hero's own
 * figure, `Night` repeated its pill, and `Paid` is a fact about the dues list —
 * it is on the Payments tab, on the card above the rows it sums.
 *
 * ## Sections are absent, not empty
 *
 * The server gates each query by its own permission flag, so an ungranted
 * section arrives as `[]` — the same payload as a section that is genuinely
 * empty. Drawing "no notices yet" at a guardian who was never granted notices
 * states something about the hostel that this app has no basis for. So each
 * block below is behind `canSee(...)`, and a guardian who was granted nothing
 * gets one honest card instead of five empty ones.
 *
 * ## Against `guardian-dashboard-page.tsx` (§5.2)
 *
 * Still not ported, and still deliberate: the web's **"Make a Payment" button**
 * (there is no guardian payment route anywhere in `apps/web`, so it did
 * nothing), and its **"Emergency Status: Normal"** tile on the safety page (the
 * payload has no SOS field, so it printed "Normal" whether or not an alert was
 * live). Telling a parent there is no emergency without having asked is the one
 * thing these screens must never do.

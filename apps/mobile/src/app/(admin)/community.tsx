 * Community, as a tab in every signed-in role — plus the one thing staff have
 * that members do not.
 *
 * The board is the same board: the feed is platform-wide, so a warden, a cook
 * and a resident read one conversation rather than three role-shaped copies of
 * it. What the admin group adds is a door in the bar to `/community-reports`,
 * because until now this tab gave an admin the *member* view of a space they
 * are responsible for policing, while the portal has carried a moderation queue
 * the whole time.
 *
 * The badge is the queue's own `flagged` count, and it is why the control is
 * here rather than one level down on More: reported posts arrive without
 * warning and nobody goes looking for them.

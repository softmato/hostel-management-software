/**
 * The reported-posts queue, and the one thing only staff can write.
 *
 * ## Why it is a route and not the Community tab itself
 *
 * The tab is the feed, and staff read the feed like everybody else — they have
 * a hostel to keep up with too. What they additionally hold is a queue and a
 * megaphone, and neither belongs in a scroll of posts: a queue is worked
 * through top to bottom and then abandoned until it refills, which is the
 * opposite rhythm to browsing. So the tab keeps a badged shield in its bar and
 * this screen holds the work.
 *
 * ## Announcements live here, not on the board
 *
 * An announcement is not a post with a flag set — it is pinned above the
 * hostel's space and only staff can write one, which makes it a *power*, and
 * the powers belong together behind one door. It is the bar's action rather
 * than a section at the bottom because "the mess is closed tonight" is the most
 * time-critical thing an admin writes from a phone, and a button under a
 * forty-card queue is not reachable in the moment that matters.
 *
 * ## Both verdicts require a reason
 *
 * The server demands 3–500 characters either way, and it is right to: hiding a
 * post and clearing one both write an audit entry that another person reads
 * later. The sheet asks rather than sending a canned string, because "Cleared
 * by admin" in an audit log is the same as no log at all.

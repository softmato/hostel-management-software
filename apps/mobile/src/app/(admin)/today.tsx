/**
 * Today — running the hostel, as opposed to owning it.
 *
 * The portal calls this group **Operations**, and until now none of it was in
 * the app: the roll call, the menu, notices and the request queues were eight
 * web links on the More tab. They are the parts of the job that happen while
 * standing up, which makes a phone the right device for them and a browser
 * handoff the wrong one.
 *
 * ## Why the roll call is first
 *
 * It is the only section with a deadline measured in hours, and the only one
 * where the phone beats the desk — a warden walking the corridor marking rooms
 * is not going to open a laptop for it. Complaints sit under it despite being
 * the section with a *badge*, because an SLA runs in days and the tab bar is
 * already carrying that number.
 *
 * ## It reports; it does not write
 *
 * Every section here is now a summary and a link, and that is the rule the
 * screen was missing. It used to hold two working copies of features that have
 * their own screens: the unverified half of the roll call with its own override
 * sheet, and a two-field notice composer missing schedule, expiry and audience.
 * Both were built when the alternative was a browser hand-off, and both outlived
 * that — `manage/roll-call` and `manage/notices` do the whole job.
 *
 * A digest that also writes is the worst of both: it disagrees with the real
 * screen about what is on it, and it offers the same action twice with
 * different options behind each. So the heading of each section links to the
 * one screen that owns it — the same destinations Home's shortcut row and
 * Manage grid use — and nothing on this page is the only way to do anything.

/**
 * Everything that needs a decision — an inbox, and shaped like one.
 *
 * ## Why it survived the retab
 *
 * Three of the four sources also live next to their own subject: claims on
 * Money, complaints on Today, SOS on Home. That is the right default — a
 * decision is easier next to the money or the roster it is about than in a feed
 * of four unrelated things.
 *
 * Inquiries are the exception, and came back here. A lead is not a member of the
 * roster, so on Residents it read as a second list stacked above the directory
 * somebody had opened to search; here it is one row in the queue of things
 * waiting, with its call and its follow-up on the card.
 *
 * What it costs is the one question the old inbox answered well: *is there
 * anything at all?* Four tabs cannot answer that without visiting four tabs, so
 * this screen stays, reachable from Home. It is the sweep, not the workflow.
 *
 * ## Filter tabs, not urgency sections
 *
 * The feed was one list ranked by consequence and nothing else, and that is
 * still what `All` shows. What it could not answer is the question people
 * actually arrive with — *what kind of thing is waiting* — and the notification
 * literature is consistent about the fix: an inbox filters by kind and marks
 * urgency **on the row**, rather than splitting into urgency-titled sections
 * that leave you scrolling three headings to find the one payment claim.
 *
 * So: five segments, exactly Material 3's cap for a segmented control, with the
 * count in each label so a tab says whether it is worth pressing before it is
 * pressed. Ranking inside every segment is unchanged, and `showKind` keeps the
 * badge on each card so a filtered view still says what it is looking at.
 *
 * ## Not the notification bell
 *
 * The bell in the other admin bars opens `/notifications`, the platform record
 * of what was *sent* to this account. This is what is still *undecided*, which
 * is a different list: a notification you have read is done with, whereas a
 * payment claim stays here until somebody approves or rejects it. This screen
 * deliberately has no bell — it would be a second inbox icon inside an inbox.
 *
 * ## It reads the group's shared queue
 *
 * No fetch of its own. `AdminAlertsProvider` in the layout holds one copy for
 * every admin screen, so opening this from Home costs nothing and approving
 * something here moves the badge behind it.

/**
 * One invoice, as a statement.
 *
 * ## Why this refetches the whole finance view
 *
 * There is no `GET /resident/finance/invoices/{id}`. The list endpoint is the
 * only resident-facing read, so the detail screen asks for it again and picks
 * its row out. That is one extra request rather than a second shape that can
 * drift from the list's — and the list is small (a resident's own months).
 *
 * ## Breakdown, then statement
 *
 * They answer different questions and both are here. The **breakdown** is what
 * the month is made of — rent, a part-month proration, an admission fee, a
 * carried credit — and it is why the total is the number it is. The
 * **statement** is what has happened to that total since: charges and payments
 * in order, with a running balance. A resident asking "why is this month more
 * than last?" wants the first; one asking "did my payment land?" wants the
 * second.
 *
 * The breakdown was blocked server-side until 2026-08-17: `Invoice.lines` had
 * always existed and `toPortalInvoice()` dropped it, so a resident could see
 * what they owed and never why.
 *
 * ## The identity is painted; the money is not
 *
 * The bar was `<AppBar accent>` — the whole strip painted, carrying the month as
 * its title — with a white summary card pulled up onto it. That put the month in
 * the same 44-point row as the back chevron, at the same size the tab bar writes
 * "Payments", which is not the treatment the *subject of the screen* deserves.
 *
 * It is two objects now. The bar is plain and says only `Invoice detail`, which
 * is what a pushed screen's bar is for. Under it sits a **painted block**
 * carrying the month large, its due date, and the status — the invoice's
 * identity — and the summary card straddles *that* block's bottom edge rather
 * than the bar's. `NOTES.md` §1: an accent header is a block with rounded bottom
 * corners with something sitting half on the colour and half on the page below.
 * A pushed screen gets to have both a bar and a header; conflating them is what
 * made the month look like a breadcrumb.
 *
 * ## The summary is a four-fact ledger, not one big number
 *
 * It showed `Still owed` in display type with a status pill beside it. That is
 * the right lead for the *pay* screen, where the only question is how much to
 * transfer. Here the question is arithmetic — a resident opening an invoice
 * after a part payment wants to see the subtraction — so the card carries
 * **total due** and **paid** as a two-up, and the outstanding figure under a
 * rule as the result. Three numbers that add up beat one number that has to be
 * taken on trust.
 *
 * ## The reference code is `<ReferenceStrip>`, shared with the pay screen
 *
 * It used to be a card of its own here: the code in 24-point tracked type, a
 * sentence under it, and then a `Copy reference` **`<ListRow>`** — a list row
 * standing in for a button, under a value that looked like a heading. One code,
 * one object, one gesture; the component's own note has the rest.
 */

/**
 * How far the summary card is pulled up onto the painted block, in points.
 *
 * Shared with `pay.tsx` and `claim.tsx`, which straddle their own blocks by the
 * same amount — the three screens are one flow, and a step that changes its
 * chrome reads as a different app.

/**
 * The receipts for this month, and the sentence that explains their absence.
 *
 * Always drawn, which it was not: the section only appeared once a receipt
 * existed, so an unpaid invoice gave a resident no indication that a receipt is
 * a thing this product will eventually hand them. A named empty state is the
 * cheaper answer to "where is my receipt" than the support message that follows
 * from a screen that never mentions receipts at all.
 *
 * Voided receipts are already excluded by the server — a receipt voided with a
 * reversed payment must not stay downloadable, or the resident keeps a document
 * asserting a payment the ledger no longer counts.
 *
 * Tapping one downloads it with the bearer token and **saves it to the device**.
 * A resident who needs proof of rent for a visa or a landlord should be one tap
 * from the PDF rather than emailing the hostel for it — and what those people
 * ask for is a file to attach, which is a saved document rather than a share
 * sheet that has to be re-opened later.

/**
 * Where the resident lands after a gateway handoff.
 *
 * ## The browser closing is not evidence
 *
 * The intent's return URL is built server-side as a **web** page —
 * `{siteUrl}/resident/payments/checkout/{reference}` — with no mobile scheme in
 * it, so the in-app browser never redirects to `hostelhub://` and there is
 * nothing to deep-link off. That is fine, because the browser closing was never
 * proof of anything: a resident can dismiss it mid-payment, or complete one and
 * lose signal before the redirect. So this screen asks the *server*, which asks
 * the *provider*, which is the only authority there is.
 *
 * ## Polling that stops
 *
 * Every second is too fast — the server calls the provider on each poll — and
 * never stopping drains a phone left on this screen. So it backs off, and it
 * halts on `settled`, on a terminal status, or once the intent expires
 * (`lib/checkout.ts`). A resident who genuinely paid but whose intent expired
 * still has the manual route: the claim form.

/**
 * Contact Us — a port of `apps/web/src/app/_components/public-contact-page.tsx`.
 *
 * ## The support channels are tappable here, and that is the point
 *
 * The web prints the email and the phone number as text inside a card. On a
 * phone the number *is* the action: a support line you have to memorise and
 * retype into the dialler is a support line nobody calls. So each method card
 * that has a `tel:` or `mailto:` behind it becomes a pressable, and the two that
 * do not — the office address and the opening hours — stay flat. Same cards,
 * same order, same descriptions.
 *
 * A card whose detail is blank is dropped rather than drawn empty: every
 * identity field except the site name is optional in Website Config, and an
 * "Email" card with nothing under it tells the reader the platform has no
 * support email, which is not what a blank field means.
 *
 * ## The FAQ is the platform's, not this screen's
 *
 * The questions and answers come from Platform → Website Config → Page Content,
 * the same list `/contact` renders. Two answers name a control rather than a
 * fact and are rewritten below for this app's chrome — see `APP_ANSWERS`.

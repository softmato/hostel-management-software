/**
 * The resident's statement — what has gone out, for what, and when.
 *
 * ## The tab it replaced
 *
 * Food. Which is a screen a resident opens to read this week's menu, and which
 * Home already leads with — today's meals sit on the dashboard with `All meals`
 * on them, so the tab was a second way to reach something already in front of
 * them. What was *not* reachable in one tap was the answer to "what have I
 * actually paid": the Payments tab is a list of months and what is open on them,
 * built around paying the next one. A resident asked by a parent, a guardian or
 * a landlord what they have paid had to read a list of debts to work it out.
 *
 * The Food screen is unchanged and still reachable from Home and from More — the
 * same way Notices was kept when Community took its slot.
 *
 * ## The hostel's statement, read from the other side
 *
 * The same screen as `app/manage/finance/statement.tsx`, to the point: the
 * painted bar with the summary card straddling it, the sticky search field, the
 * collapse pill on the hairline, the day groups with the heading outside the
 * card, the filter sheet and the detail sheet. Everything that filters,
 * searches, groups and totals is literally the same code — see
 * `lib/hostel-statement.ts` — so a fix to either lands on both.
 *
 * What differs is the direction, and therefore the words. Every row here is a
 * **debit**: money the resident paid, drawn red with a downward caret against
 * the hostel side's green and up, `Total paid` rather than `Total received`. The
 * red is the wallet vocabulary of the reference apps, not an alarm — see
 * `<Money>`'s `tone`.
 *
 * The per-row action pill differs too. The hostel's is `Resident`, because on
 * that side the person is what a row is about; here every row is the same
 * person, so the pill opens the **invoice** — the thing with the receipt on it.
 *
 * ## Export is one tap, not a format sheet
 *
 * The hostel's export asks PDF or spreadsheet, because an owner reconciles
 * against a spreadsheet and hands a bank a PDF. A resident has one audience for
 * this document — whoever is asking them to prove they paid — and one server
 * route behind it, `GET /resident/finance/statement/pdf`. So the button
 * downloads, and a sheet with a single row in it would be a tap charged for
 * nothing.
 *
 * ## The read is already warm
 *
 * `residentQuery.finance()` is the same descriptor the Payments tab holds and
 * the same one `prefetchResidentPortal` warms at the door, so this tab costs no
 * request at all — it paints from the cache the portal filled on the way in.

 * gave **eSewa and Khalti the same glyph** — `phone-portrait-outline` — so on a
 * ledger of a resident's own payments the two wallets they actually use were
 * indistinguishable pictures.
 *
 * The marks arrived on 2026-09-05. `<WalletMark>` draws the real one and keeps
 * the tinted glyph tile as the fallback for bank and cash, so the direction tone
 * these rows depend on survives.

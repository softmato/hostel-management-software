/**
 * One job: where it is, who to call, and the two things this provider can say
 * about it.
 *
 * ## Why it reloads the whole list
 *
 * There is no `GET /public/service-providers/me/jobs/{id}`. The list endpoint
 * is already scoped to the caller's own assignments and capped at 100, so
 * fetching it and picking the row is one round trip with no new server surface
 * — and it means a job that was reassigned away shows "not found" rather than
 * stale detail a provider might act on. If the list ever needs paging, this is
 * the call site that wants a real detail route.
 *
 * ## Two actions, deliberately
 *
 * An open board job offers one action instead: Accept. It moves the job to
 * CONTACTED and reloads the board, which is what brings the hostel's number and
 * the voice note — neither is sent for a job nobody has taken.
 *
 * `serviceProviderJobStatusSchema` accepts `CONTACTED` and `COMPLETED` and
 * nothing else. Cancelling is the hostel's decision, scheduling carries a date
 * this screen has no field for, and reopening a signed-off job would let a
 * provider un-finish paid work. A 409 back from either action is worth showing
 * verbatim — the server's messages say what to do next.

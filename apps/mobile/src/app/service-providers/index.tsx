 * "Become a service provider" — the app's version of `/service-providers`.
 *
 * The pitch, the stat strip and the sections are the platform's configured copy,
 * shared with the website's hero. What is different is who is reading: this
 * screen is inside the app an approved provider will actually work from, so it
 * can say that plainly, recognise a provider who has already been approved
 * instead of inviting them to apply twice, and — since 2026-08-19 — take the
 * application itself rather than handing it to a browser.
 *
 * ## The apply block moved to the top
 *
 * It used to be `extra`, i.e. after the intro, the four stats and every section.
 * On a phone that is two screenfuls of scrolling before the one control on the
 * page. A tradesperson who opened this screen having already decided to apply had
 * to read the argument for applying in order to find the button. See
 * `InfoActions`.

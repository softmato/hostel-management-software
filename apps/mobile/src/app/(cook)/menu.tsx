/**
 * The week's routine, and who is eating it. Read-only, both of them.
 *
 * ## Two things on one tab, on purpose
 *
 * They are the kitchen's two reference reads — what to cook, and how many
 * plates — and a cook checks them together at the start of a shift. Splitting
 * them would cost a tab from a five-tab bar whose other slots (announce, photo,
 * community) are things done rather than looked up.
 *
 * ## The week is `<FoodRoutineWeek>` now, not a third copy of it
 *
 * This screen used to build its own day strip — a horizontal `ScrollView` of
 * hand-rolled filled pills — and then map `MEAL_TYPES` into `<MealRow>`s
 * underneath it. Which is precisely what `components/food-routine.tsx` already
 * does, off the same `FoodRoutine` payload, for the resident's Food tab and for
 * `(admin)/today.tsx`. Three renderings of one menu is how "the app said
 * chicken" starts, and the kitchen's copy was the one most likely to diverge
 * because it was the one nobody was looking at while editing the others.
 *
 * The shared component also brings two things this screen did not have: today
 * is marked on the strip even when another day is selected, so a cook who has
 * browsed to Friday can find their way back, and each meal gets the icon square
 * the rest of the app uses.
 *
 * **No `mealFooter`.** That slot is where the resident's rating form goes; the
 * kitchen has nothing to put in it, which is the whole reason the component
 * takes a slot rather than owning the control.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is editable, and that is the product
 *
 * `PUT /hostel-admin/food/routine` is behind `manageFood`, a hostel-staff
 * capability a COOK does not hold — and rightly: the menu is what the hostel
 * has promised its residents, and the kitchen changing it silently is how a
 * hostel ends up serving something other than what it advertised. The routine
 * arrives on `GET /cook/today` alongside today's meals, so the week costs no
 * request of its own.
 *
 * ## The roster is two fields, and now searchable
 *
 * Name and room type. No phone, no email, nothing contactable — the cook login
 * is shared kitchen-wide and effectively static, so this is the list most
 * exposed by a leaked password, and it is deliberately worth no more than a
 * noticeboard.
 *
 * The field appears **only once the list is long enough to need it**, which is
 * the rule `(admin)/money.tsx` states for its own search: a hostel with eight
 * residents can see all eight, and a search box over eight rows is a control
 * that exists to be ignored. `searchCookResidents` matches the room type as it
 * is *written on screen*, so `double sharing` finds `DOUBLE_SHARING`.
 *
 * ## Two reads, two resources
 *
 * The week and the roster fail independently, and a kitchen whose roster errors
 * should still be able to read the menu. They were one combined `loadMenu`
 * before, which meant either failure blanked both.

/**
 * A photo of the meal, taken with the camera in the kitchen.
 *
 * ## Camera first, library second
 *
 * Food transparency is the point of the feed: a picture of *this* meal, taken
 * now. Opening the library first invites a stock photo or last week's curry, so
 * the primary action launches the camera and the library is the secondary
 * button — the same order the web's uploader offers, inverted for a device that
 * has a camera in hand.
 *
 * ## The meal type is guessed, not asked
 *
 * `mealTypeNow()` reads the Kathmandu clock. A picker between "I want to share
 * this" and the photo being shared is where people give up, and a wrong bucket
 * costs the hostel nothing — nobody audits which meal a curry photo landed in.
 *
 * ## One feed, now readable from both ends
 *
 * `POST /cook/food-photos` writes the same `FoodPhoto` collection the resident
 * and admin routes write to, and publishes on the FOOD topic, so a photo appears
 * on residents' food screens as it is posted. Until 2026-08-18 that route was
 * **POST-only** — the kitchen could post a photo of dinner and had no way to see
 * it, or to see whether anyone had posted at all today, while every resident in
 * the hostel could. `GET /cook/food-photos` closes that, and this screen now
 * shows the same rows the residents see rather than a local approximation of
 * them.
 *
 * ## Grouped by day, by the server
 *
 * Nepal is +05:45, so a breakfast photographed at 05:30 local is `23:45Z` the
 * *previous* day. Grouping on the phone would hand that decision to the
 * handset's timezone, and a cook whose phone is set to anything else would see
 * this morning's breakfast filed under yesterday. `food-photo-days.ts` does it
 * in `Asia/Kathmandu` and sends the day key down.
 *
 * The **meals covered** count per day is the number the kitchen is actually
 * judged on: four photos of dinner is not the same as one of each meal, and a
 * photo count cannot tell those apart.
 *
 * ## The announcement history left this tab
 *
 * It used to sit under the photo feed: every meal this kitchen has ever called,
 * on a tab named "Photos". Two subjects on one screen, and the wrong one was
 * growing — a hostel serving four meals a day fills that list with a hundred and
 * twenty rows a month, under the control a cook opens this tab to press.
 *
 * "Did I already announce lunch?" is answered on **Today**, on the meal's own
 * card, which carries `Sent 12:04`. "What has this kitchen called, and from
 * which handset?" is a record, asked rarely, and it is now on **More**, beside
 * the device fingerprint that is stamped on every one of those rows. Two
 * questions, two homes, and this tab is one subject again.

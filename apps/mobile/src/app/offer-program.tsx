/**
 * The Resident Offer Program explainer.
 *
 * **Public, and deliberately so.** Every other surface that mentions the
 * programme is behind a login, but the two moments a resident most wants to read
 * about it are moments they are not signed in: the confirmation email that lands
 * seconds after they submit a payment proof, and the conversation with a parent
 * paying the rent who has no account at all. Both of those arrive at this screen
 * from a link, so it has to render for a signed-out reader.
 *
 * The copy is the platform's configured copy, shared with `/resident-offer-
 * program` on the website. What is not shared is the block below it.
 */

/**
 * The apply block — the one part of this screen that is not the same for
 * everyone, and a port of the website's `ApplyBlock`.
 *
 * Three states, and the distinction that matters is the third: someone signed in
 * who is not a resident. Showing them "Apply" would send them to a dashboard
 * they cannot open, and showing them the signed-out pitch would tell them to
 * create an account they already have. Both are dead ends, and both are what a
 * two-state check produces.
 *
 * **Eligibility is read from the session, not from a request.** It is a property
 * of being a resident with invoices, which is already true or already false by
 * the time anyone reads this; there is no approval to grant and nothing to
 * await. `isResidentActivated` is not consulted — an invited resident who has
 * not scanned their QR yet is still a resident, and telling them they are
 * ineligible would be wrong about the programme rather than about their session.

/**
 * `hostelhub://guardian-invite?token=…` — the emailed guardian invitation.
 *
 * ## The path matches the email, deliberately
 *
 * `guardian-invite.service.ts` builds `acceptUrl` as
 * `{siteUrl}/guardian-invite?token=<token>`, so this route's file name is that
 * path. The moment verified app links are configured (M6's open item), the
 * https link in the email opens *this* screen instead of the browser, with no
 * further work — and until then `hostelhub://guardian-invite?token=…` already
 * resolves here, cold start and warm alike, because expo-router treats the file
 * name as the handler.
 *
 * ## Accepting does not sign you in
 *
 * `acceptGuardianInvitation` returns `{ accepted, accountCreated, email,
 * hostelName, requiresLogin }` and **no session** — the server emails
 * credentials for a freshly created or upgraded account rather than minting a
 * token for whoever opened a link. So the success state hands off to login with
 * the address prefilled rather than pretending to land the user in the app.
 *
 * ## One tap only
 *
 * Accepting clears the token server-side, so a second attempt returns
 * `GUARDIAN_INVITATION_INVALID`. The button is therefore gone once it has
 * succeeded — not merely disabled — and the error copy names expiry (7 days)
 * and reuse as the two likely causes rather than saying "something went wrong".

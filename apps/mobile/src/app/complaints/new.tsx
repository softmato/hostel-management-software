/**
 * Raising one.
 *
 * ## The screen is a camera with a question above it
 *
 * It used to be a form: a category picker, a title, a four-line description box
 * and a dashed square that opened the photo library. Five fields, two of them
 * mandatory, to say that the shower is broken — and the mandatory ones were the
 * two nobody has an answer to. A title is a thing a form wants; a person
 * standing in a flooded bathroom has a photograph and a sentence.
 *
 * So what is left is:
 *
 * 1. **What is this about** — eight tiles, one tap, no sheet. It is the only
 *    thing the resident knows better than we do, and it decides which admin
 *    sees the complaint first.
 * 2. **The camera**, already running. See `<PhotoCapture>` for why it is live
 *    rather than behind an "Add photo" button.
 * 3. **Their voice**, by default. Holding the mic and saying "the tap in 204
 *    has been running since Tuesday and the floor is soaked" takes eight
 *    seconds and carries what four lines of typing would not. Typing is still
 *    there — one tap away, and the same control underneath.
 *
 * The title is gone entirely; the server derives one from the first line of
 * whatever came in, or from the category when nothing did. See
 * `complaint-title.ts`.
 *
 * ## Photos upload on pick, not on submit
 *
 * Each picture runs the full presign → PUT → complete pipeline the moment it is
 * taken and the screen keeps the returned `assetId`. Two reasons: an asset that
 * never *completes* is a reservation the hostel cannot open, so the completion
 * has to be visible before the complaint references it; and uploading four
 * photos inside the submit handler makes the one tap that matters take thirty
 * seconds with nothing to show for it.
 *
 * The **recording** goes the other way — it is uploaded on submit, like the
 * maintenance one, because re-recording is what people do and every discarded
 * take would otherwise be an orphaned asset nothing ever collects.
 *
 * Progress is not drawn here — `uploadAsset` registers with the queue that the
 * always-mounted `<UploadToaster />` renders. The thumbnails are the *local*
 * files, which need no auth and no round trip.
 *
 * ## Anonymous hides the name from staff, not from the record
 *
 * `isAnonymous` nulls `residentId` in the *admin's* serialization only, and
 * `auditComplaintAction` still writes `actorId` on creation. The complaint is
 * also still the resident's own in their own list. The row's caption says all
 * three, rather than implying untraceability the server does not provide.

   *
   * ## The type is carried, never assumed
   *
   * `mimeType` is passed through rather than filled in here. R2 signs the
   * declared content type into the presigned URL, and `/files/{id}/complete`
   * then reads the stored object back and refuses it if the bytes disagree with

/**
 * Saved hostels — the shortlist, on a screen of its own.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The Profile tab's "Saved hostels" row used to `push("/(browse)")`, i.e. the
 * Home tab, on the reasoning that Home already draws a Saved row. What that
 * actually did was switch tabs and drop the reader at the top of a discovery
 * feed with their shortlist somewhere below five other sections — a row you have
 * to go looking for, in a horizontal carousel, three screenfuls down. Tapping a
 * row labelled "Saved hostels" and landing on a screen that is mostly not your
 * saved hostels is the kind of thing that reads as a broken link.
 *
 * So the row now leads here, and this screen is only the shortlist: a full-width
 * vertical list, every entry visible, each removable where it sits. The
 * horizontal row on Home stays exactly as it is — it is a *glance* at the
 * shortlist inside a browsing screen, and this is the shortlist itself.
 *
 * ## Device-local, and it says so
 *
 * There is no favourites collection on the server (`lib/saved-hostels.ts`), so
 * this list does not follow anyone to another phone. The subtitle says that
 * where it is always visible rather than in a toast that disappears.
 *
 * ## The prices refresh, the list does not depend on it
 *
 * Each entry is a stored snapshot, so this screen renders complete and instantly
 * with no network at all — including offline, and including a hostel that has
 * since dropped out of the server's first-60 window. Pull-to-refresh folds newer
 * prices and photos in through `sync`, which writes nothing when nothing has
 * changed. A failed fetch is therefore not an error state here: there is nothing
 * on screen that came from it.

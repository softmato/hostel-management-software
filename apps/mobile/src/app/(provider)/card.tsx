/**
 * The provider's own record, and the door to their platform ID card.
 *
 * ## Two different cards, and only one of them lives here
 *
 * The *platform* ID card — the printable document with the QR, shared by
 * residents, owners and providers alike — is `app/id-card/`, and it already
 * renders the `SERVICE_PROVIDER` variant off `identity.cardType`. Rebuilding it
 * here would be a second renderer for the same document, which is how the two
 * drift apart. So this screen shows the *application*: what the platform holds
 * about this provider and whether it has been approved, with a row through to
 * the card itself.
 *
 * ## The status tag is the point of the screen
 *
 * `PENDING_APPROVAL` is not a soft state: an unapproved provider gets an empty
 * job list from the server, because `listOwnServiceProviderJobs` filters on an
 * APPROVED record. Without this tag, "no jobs yet" and "your application has
 * not been reviewed" look identical — the same empty-versus-denied confusion
 * the guardian screens are built to avoid.

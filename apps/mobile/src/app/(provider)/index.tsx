/**
 * The provider's job board: open jobs they can accept (their trade first, then
 * every other trade), then their own work, open first.
 *
 * Accepting happens on the job screen, which is also where a provider reads the
 * description before committing — a one-tap accept on a row would take jobs
 * nobody had read.
 *
 * ## Nothing about residents appears here
 *
 * `listOwnServiceProviderJobs` returns the hostel's name, area and phone and
 * deliberately no resident details: a maintenance job is about a place. The
 * `location` string ("Room 204") is free text the admin typed, not a link to
 * anybody.
 *
 * ## The front door of a portal, not a list with a label on it
 *
 * This tab opened on `<AppBar title="Jobs" />` while every other role's home
 * opened on the platform lockup, the bell and a painted account card. Two things
 * were actually wrong with that. The app never said what it was to the one
 * audience that installs it for work rather than for a room — and the bell was
 * missing from all four provider tabs, in a portal the server routes four push
 * categories to. `<ProviderHero>` carries the rest; see `provider-home.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Against `provider-jobs-page.tsx` (§5.4)
 *
 * The web draws each job as a full card — title, hostel, description, category,
 * location, schedule and phone. **The rows stay rows here.** A provider opens
 * this to answer "how much work do I have and where", and eight cards deep
 * enough to hold a description is two jobs per screenful; the detail screen
 * already carries the description, the voice note and the call button, which is
 * the tap the web card exists to save and a phone does not need saving.
 *
 * What the rows lacked was a grid. Every fact sat wherever its neighbour left
 * room — see `META_WIDTH` in `provider-home.tsx` for the ragged right edge that
 * fixed.

/**
 * `hostelhub://cook-invite?token=…` — the emailed cook invitation.
 *
 * The sibling of `guardian-invite.tsx`, and deliberately the same shape,
 * because it is the same problem: an emailed link that grants a scoped role on
 * an address the recipient already controls.
 *
 * ## The path matches the email
 *
 * `cook-roster.service.ts` builds `acceptUrl` as
 * `{siteUrl}/cook-invite?token=<token>`, so this route's file name is that
 * path. Once verified app links are configured the https link in the email
 * opens this screen instead of the browser with no further work, and until then
 * `hostelhub://cook-invite?token=…` already resolves here.
 *
 * ## Accepting does not sign you in
 *
 * The server returns no session — it creates or upgrades an account and emails
 * the credentials — so the success state hands off to login with the address
 * prefilled rather than pretending to land the cook in the app.
 *
 * ## One tap only
 *
 * Accepting clears the token server-side, so a second attempt returns
 * `COOK_INVITATION_INVALID`. The button is therefore *gone* once it has
 * succeeded, not merely disabled, and the error copy names expiry (7 days) and
 * reuse as the two likely causes.

/**
 * Who this card belongs to, and everything the hostel knows about them.
 *
 * ## The screen the scan exists for
 *
 * A hostel owner holding somebody's ID card in a corridor is asking one
 * question with several parts: is this person ours, which room, are they paid
 * up, who do I call if something happens to them, and is there anything about
 * them I should know before I let them past. This screen answers all of it in
 * one scroll and does not send anyone to the browser for the rest — see the
 * "no browser hand-offs" rule.
 *
 * ## Two owners, two halves, and the screen says which is which
 *
 * `profile` is the holder's **own** portable profile — their blood group, their
 * guardians, their government ID — disclosed under a sharing switch they
 * control, and they get a notification every time it is read.
 *
 * `membership` is the hostel's **own** tenancy record — the row it typed in,
 * the money it billed, the complaints it was sent. It is not gated on that
 * switch, because a toggle on somebody's platform profile cannot take a
 * hostel's roster away from it.
 *
 * Either can be absent, and when one is, the server sends the reason as a
 * sentence rather than an empty object. This screen prints that sentence where
 * the data would have been. That is why there is no error state for a card that
 * scanned fine but has little behind it.
 *
 * ## The money can be refused on its own
 *
 * `viewPayments` is a separate warden grant, so `ledger: null` with
 * `ledgerDenied: true` is a normal answer. A missing ledger and a resident who
 * owes nothing must never look the same — one is "we were not allowed to look",
 * the other is "they are straight with you" — so the section prints which.
 *
 * ## Layout
 *
 * Painted identity block with a rounded bottom and the actions straddling its
 * edge (NOTES.md §1, §2), then label/value grids in cards (§8). Nothing here is
 * a summary of a screen one tap away; this *is* the detail view.

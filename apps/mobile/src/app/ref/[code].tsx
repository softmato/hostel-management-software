/**
 * `hostelhub://ref/<code>` — a resident's referral link.
 *
 * ## Cold start and warm start are both expo-router's job
 *
 * The file name *is* the deep-link handler. expo-router resolves
 * `hostelhub://ref/ABC123` to this route whether the app was already running or
 * was launched by the tap, so there is no `getInitialURL`/`addEventListener`
 * pair to write and, more to the point, no cold-start case to forget.
 *
 * ## This is the only consumer of a referral link in the product
 *
 * `referral.service.ts` has been handing residents a `/inquiry?ref=<code>` link
 * to share, but the web's `/inquiry` page reads `hostel` and `room` and ignores
 * `ref` entirely — and nothing outside a test has ever called
 * `/public/inquiries/with-referral`. So every referral shared until now has been
 * dropped, and this screen is the first thing that credits one. Logged in
 * MOBILE_APP_PHASES.md §M6; the web page needs the same treatment.
 *
 * ## The hostel cannot be named
 *
 * The server resolves the code to `referralCode.hostelId` and files the inquiry
 * against *that* hostel. No public endpoint maps a code to a hostel, so the app
 * genuinely does not know which one this is. The copy therefore says "your
 * friend's hostel" rather than inventing a name — a screen that guessed and got
 * it wrong would send someone's details to the wrong place with confidence.

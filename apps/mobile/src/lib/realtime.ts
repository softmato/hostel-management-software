/**
 * The Pusher socket.
 *
 * Mirrors `apps/web/src/components/realtime-provider.tsx` — same channels, same
 * events, same degradation — with two differences that are forced by the
 * platform rather than chosen.
 *
 * ## 1. `require`, and pull `.Pusher` off the namespace
 *
 * The default browser build references DOM globals that do not exist in Hermes.
 * The React Native build does not, but its v8 webpack bundle ends with
 * `module.exports.Pusher = r` — so `import Pusher from "pusher-js/react-native"`
 * resolves to `undefined` and `new undefined()` throws "constructor is not
 * callable". The class has to be read off the required namespace explicitly.
 *
 * It also imports `@react-native-community/netinfo` at load time; Metro
 * redirects that to `src/shims/netinfo.js`. See `metro.config.js`.
 *
 * ## 2. A custom authorizer, because there is no cookie
 *
 * The web sets `authEndpoint: "/api/v1/realtime/auth"` and lets the browser
 * attach the session cookie. A phone has no cookie — it has a bearer token that
 * rotates. Pusher's `auth.headers` option is read **once, at construction**, so
 * a token captured there goes stale at the first refresh and every subsequent
 * subscribe 401s; the socket stays up and simply stops receiving, which is the
 * hardest possible version of this bug to notice.
 *
 * So authorisation goes through `api` — the axios instance that already
 * attaches the current token and handles 401 → refresh → retry. One
 * implementation of session handling, not two.
 *
 * ## Everything here is optional
 *
 * No credentials on the server, a blocked socket, a failed config fetch: all
 * end at "no socket", and the app keeps working on `use-resource`'s
 * refetch-on-focus. Nothing in this file is load-bearing for correctness — it
 * only shortens the delay.

 * ## Why not `Intl`

 * OS's, not the bundle's — so `en-NP` grouping and `Asia/Kathmandu` resolve
 * differently on an Android 9 handset than on the simulator, and an
 * unrecognised locale silently degrades to `en-US`. Money on an invoice is not
 * a place for "usually right", so the grouping and the timezone shift are done
 * by hand here. They are pure functions, which is also what makes them
 * testable under the repo's node-environment Vitest setup.
 *
 * ## Nepal time
 *
 * NPT is a fixed UTC+05:45 with no daylight saving, so one constant offset is
 * the whole implementation. This matters more than it looks: a payment made at
 * 00:30 Kathmandu time is still *yesterday* in UTC, and a dashboard that says
 * "today's menu" while reading UTC days serves the wrong dinner for the last
 * 5 hours 45 minutes of every day.

 *
 * Every BS string in this app comes through here, so the conversion has exactly
 * one timezone bug to get wrong rather than one per call site.
 *
 * ## Why the local constructor, and not `Date.UTC`
 *
 * `nepali-date-converter` converts with `getFullYear()` / `getMonth()` /
 * `getDate()` — the **device-local** getters (`convertToBS` in its `es5` build).
 * So the `Date` handed to it is only read correctly when its *local* fields are
 * the day we mean.
 *
 * This used to build `new Date(Date.UTC(y, m, d, 12))`. Noon UTC survives every
 * offset from -11 to +11 and breaks past that: on a phone set to Auckland
 * (UTC+12, +13 in summer) or Fiji, noon UTC is already **the next day** locally,
 * and every Nepali date in the app read one day ahead — an invoice due 1 Bhadra
 * shown as 2 Bhadra, with the Gregorian date beside it still correct. A silent
 * one-day disagreement between the two calendars on the same row is the exact
 * failure the BS support exists to prevent.
 *
 * `new Date(y, m, d, 12)` sets the local fields directly, so they read back as
 * `y`/`m`/`d` in every timezone there is. Noon rather than midnight because no
 * daylight-saving transition anywhere skips the middle of the day, while
 * several skip the start of it.
 *
 * Throws for a day outside the converter's 2000–2090 BS table — callers catch
 * and fall back to Gregorian rather than printing a guess.

 * The same instant in Bikram Sambat — `Bhadra 2, 2083 BS`.
 *
 * ## Why the month leads, and why the era is spelled out
 *
 * `D MMMM YYYY` (`2 Bhadra 2083`) is how the converter formats by default and
 * it is not how a Nepali date is written down. A notice board, a receipt book
 * and a government form all put the month first and the year last — `Shrawan
 * 26, 2083` — and they all say **BS**, because `2083` on its own is a number
 * that could be a Gregorian year somebody mistyped.
 *
 * The marker matters more here than it would in a Nepali-only product: this app
 * prints both calendars on the same card in several places, and a reader
 * scanning a column of dates needs to know which one they are in without
 * working it out from the magnitude of the year.
 *
 * ## Why both calendars, everywhere a date is money
 *
 * Decided 2026-08-17: **show both, side by side**, rather than choosing one.
 * Nobody in Nepal reads a rent due date in a single calendar — the hostel's
 * books run on BS and the bank's statement runs on AD — so a one-calendar date
 * makes somebody convert in their head at exactly the moment a mistake costs
 * money.
 *
 * ## The conversion is a dependency, deliberately
 *
 * BS month lengths **vary per year** and cannot be calculated; they are a
 * tabulated table of real data. Hand-copying ~30 years of it would be inventing
 * data that looks authoritative and is wrong in one cell nobody notices for a
 * year. `nepali-date-converter` (MIT) carries the table, and it was checked here
 * against five known New Year anchors — 2013-04-14, 2023-04-14, 2024-04-13,
 * 2025-04-14 and 2026-04-14 all land on Baisakh 1 — before being adopted.
 *
 * ## Nepal time first
 *
 * The conversion runs on the *Nepal* calendar day, not the device's. An invoice
 * due "1 Bhadra" must read the same on a phone left on another timezone, which
 * is the same reason `nepalParts` exists.

 *
 * The stakes: R2 signs the `Content-Type` into the presigned URL. If the type
 * declared at presign is not the type sent on the PUT, the upload fails with a
 * signature error that mentions nothing about content types — so both have to
 * come from one function, and that function must always return something.

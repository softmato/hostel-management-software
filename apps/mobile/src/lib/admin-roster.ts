 * ## Why `MOVED_OUT` is not a bucket
 *
 * `listAdminResidents` asks for a page of 50 with no status filter, so a hostel
 * with turnover has former residents in the same array as current ones. Counting
 * them would put a number on the banner that grows forever and means nothing —
 * "58 residents" for a hostel with 40 beds. `active` is the figure that answers
 * *how many people live here*, `total` is what the list below is actually
 * showing, and they are both stated so the difference is visible rather than
 * being a discrepancy somebody has to work out.
 *
 * ## Anything unrecognised counts toward neither
 *
 * The server owns this enum — `ACTIVE`, `PENDING`, `MOVED_OUT` today — and a
 * member added later must not be silently folded into `active`, which is the
 * figure a hostel would check against its own beds. It lands in `total` only,
 * where being one short is visible rather than wrong.

 * use filter chips: chips imply two could be on at once, and "living here" and
 * "to move in" have no intersection to offer.
 *
 * `all` is last in the control and is not the default. A hostel's roster
 * accumulates former residents forever, so opening on it means opening on a list
 * whose top rows are people who left — the default is the one an admin came for.

 * ## Why not the server's `q`
 *
 * `residentListQuerySchema` takes one, so a server search exists — but the page
 * this screen already holds is 50 rows, which is most hostels in full, and a
 * request per keystroke over a hostel's connection feels worse than filtering
 * what is already in hand. A hostel large enough to page is a hostel whose admin
 * is at a desk, which is what the portal link on More is for.
 *
 * Matches across name, phone and room type **as one joined string**, so typing a
 * first name and a room type together still finds the row. Case-insensitive, and
 * an empty or whitespace-only query returns everything rather than nothing —
 * the field starts empty and must not start by hiding the list.

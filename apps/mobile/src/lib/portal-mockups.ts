 * Device mockups of the product, the same files the website shows.

 * **Fetched, not bundled.** They live in `apps/web/public/mockups/` and are
 * served by the website's CDN; `expo-image` keeps them on disk after the first
 * view. Fifteen screenshots in `assets/` would add ~1.7 MB to every install and
 * every OTA update for pictures most people see once. A copy in R2 would be a
 * second copy of the website's own static files, with an upload step to forget.
 *
 * Every file is a transparent WebP with no backdrop, so it sits on either
 * theme. `aspect` is width / height of the file.

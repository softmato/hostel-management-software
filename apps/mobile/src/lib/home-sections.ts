/**
 * Deriving the home screen's sections from the one listing payload it already
 * holds.
 *
 * `/public/hostels` returns the first 60 rows, cheapest-first, with no
 * pagination — so every row on the home screen is a *slice of one request*
 * rather than a round trip per heading. That is what keeps a screen with six
 * carousels to a single fetch, and it is also the honest limit on all of it: the
 * counts below describe what came back, not the whole database.
 *
 * These live in `lib/` so they can be tested. Vitest runs node-side with no
 * React Native shim, so anything that imports `react-native` is untestable by
 * construction, and the grouping is the part worth a test — a city that appears
 * under two spellings, or a showcase that leads with a hostel that has no photo.
 *
 * This file replaced `home-stats.ts`, which computed the mockup's "500+ Verified
 * Hostels" band from real figures. The band is gone: the home screen is a
 * listings screen, and a row of platform statistics is furniture, however true
 * the numbers were.

 * The cities the "Popular Cities" row shows, and how many listings each has.

 * ## The row is configured, not derived
 *
 * It used to be `cityCounts` — whatever cities happened to appear in the first
 * 60 listings. That makes the row a mirror of the catalogue rather than a way
 * into it: a platform launching in Pokhara has no Pokhara card until somebody
 * has already listed there. The order now comes from the superadmin's
 * **Website Config → Locations** page (`locationsSchema`, the same list that
 * fills the public search filters), so the cities the business is opening in are
 * on the home screen before the first hostel registers.
 *
 * **A configured city with no listings still gets a card, showing `0`.** That is
 * the honest version: the card opens onto a browse screen that will say the same
 * thing, and a row that silently drops the empty ones is a row that changes shape
 * as hostels come and go.
 *
 * ## Cities nobody configured are still reachable
 *
 * Any city that has listings but is missing from the config is appended after
 * the configured ones rather than hidden — otherwise a hostel in an unlisted
 * city would be unreachable from this screen the moment somebody forgot to add
 * it upstairs.
 *
 * ## Matching is exact-but-case-insensitive, on purpose
 *
 * The same key `cityCounts` groups by and `inCity` filters on. A looser match
 * here — folding "Chitwan" into "Bharatpur", say — would make the count on the
 * card disagree with the results behind it, which is the one thing these two
 * must never do.

 *
 * Six carousels were cut from this screen because they were slices of one
 * payload under headings that did not mean anything — "Popular right now" and
 * "Newly listed" held the same hostels. This one is a different set, not a
 * different order: an unrated hostel **cannot** appear here, so the row answers
 * a question the showcase above it does not — "what have other students
 * actually rated well" — and on a catalogue where nobody has reviewed anything
 * it is empty and the caller draws no heading at all.
 *
 * ## `total`, never `averageRating`, decides who is in it
 *
 * Every average comes back `0` before the first review, so filtering on the
 * average would silently keep unrated hostels and sort them last — a "Top Rated"
 * row padded out with hostels that have no rating. Ties break on the number of
 * reviews and then on the name: 4.8 from 40 people outranks 4.8 from one, and
 * two identical hostels do not swap places between two fetches of the same data.

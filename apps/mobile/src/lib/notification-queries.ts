/**
 * The bell's read, named once — the one question every portal asks.
 *
 * The sibling of `admin-queries.ts`, `resident-queries.ts`, `cook-queries.ts`
 * and `guardian-queries.ts`, and the only one of the five that belongs to no
 * portal at all. `GET /notifications` runs `requireApiPrincipal` and filters on
 * `userId` with no role branch, so a resident, a warden, a cook, a guardian, a
 * service provider and a signed-in browsing account all ask it — which is
 * exactly why it could not live in any one portal's registry, the same argument
 * `role-tabs.tsx` already makes for the community board.
 *
 * ## One key for the bell and the screen
 *
 * This was two requests for one answer. `<NotificationBell>` fetched
 * `filter=unread` for its badge and `app/notifications.tsx` fetched `filter=all`
 * for its list, both with no `cacheKey`, so every screen carrying a bell asked
 * on mount and the screen the bell opened asked again — on the tab bars where a
 * bell sits on four of five tabs, that is four requests to draw one number.
 *
 * They are now the same key. `listNotifications` counts `unreadCount` and
 * `actionCount` over the whole mailbox rather than over the page it returns —
 * `notification.service.ts` says so in as many words — so the `all` payload
 * carries everything the badge needs. The badge paints from cache, the screen
 * paints from the same entry, and marking a row read moves both at once because
 * `use-resource`'s optimistic `setData` writes back to the key they share.
 *
 * ## Why the feed is worth warming and most reads are not
 *
 * The bell is drawn on nearly every tab of every portal, so the answer is needed
 * whether or not anybody opens it — the badge is the read. That makes it the
 * cheapest possible warm-up to justify: it is not speculation about where
 * somebody will go next, it is the number already on screen.

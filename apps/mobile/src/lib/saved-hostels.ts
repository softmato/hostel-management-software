/**
 * Favourites, and the snapshot that makes them work offline.
 *
 * ## These live on the device, and only on the device
 *
 * There is no favourites collection on the server — no route, no model, nothing
 * (docs/mockups/mobile/README.md §"What these need from the server"). The heart
 * in the mockups was therefore cut along with the Saved tab. What is here
 * instead is honest about its scope: a list held in Redux, persisted by
 * `redux-persist`, that never leaves the phone. Sign in on another device and it
 * is empty, which is why the section says so.
 *
 * ## Why a snapshot rather than a list of ids
 *
 * `/public/hostels` returns the **first 60, cheapest-first**, with no
 * pagination. A saved hostel can therefore be missing from the payload the home
 * screen holds — priced out of the window, filtered, or delisted entirely — and
 * a Favourites row built from `ids ∩ payload` would quietly drop it. The user
 * saved it; it has to still be there.
 *
 * So each entry carries the few strings the card draws. The section renders from
 * those alone, which also means it survives a cold offline start, and
 * `refreshedSnapshots` folds in newer values whenever the hostel does come back
 * in a payload.
 *
 * ## The photo is stored unresolved
 *
 * `coverUrl` is the raw, usually **relative**, value from the payload
 * (`/api/v1/files/<id>/url`) — not the absolute URL the `<Image>` needs. Photo
 * URLs are resolved against `API_BASE_URL` at render time (see `lib/media.ts`),
 * and that base is a LAN address in development. Persisting the resolved form
 * would bake yesterday's IP onto disk and the favourite would render as a grey
 * box on the next launch.

 * Folds fresher values into the saved list, and returns `null` when nothing

 * consumer — on each pull-to-refresh. `savedAt` is preserved, so refreshing a
 * price never reorders the list.

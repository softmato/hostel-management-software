 * amount is "somebody was billed incorrectly". An owner then goes looking for a
 * fault that is not there, or worse, "corrects" it.
 *
 * One word on the row removes the question. It is deliberately not a *warning*
 * tone: nothing is wrong, and a badge that pulls the eye would be competing with
 * the overdue pill next to it, which is the thing on this screen that genuinely
 * wants attention.
 *
 * Compared as strings, because `moveInDate` arrives as an ISO instant and the
 * period is `YYYY-MM` — the same test `hostel-admin-payments-page` already makes
 * on the web, and one that cannot drift across a timezone the way two parsed
 * dates could.

/**
 * The two views the Payments tab switches between.
 *
 * ## Why this is two and was four
 *
 * It was `owing | overdue | unbilled | settled`, drawn as a four-segment control
 * with a count on each. Three of those four counted the *same people twice*:
 * `owing` is every unsettled row and `overdue` and `unbilled` are both subsets
 * of it, so the control read `Owing 23 · Overdue 8 · Unbilled 3 · Paid 17` over
 * a roster of 40 — four numbers that cannot be added up, in the one place on the
 * screen where a reader is entitled to assume the tabs partition the list.
 *
 * Nesting is not something a segmented control can say. What the two subsets
 * were actually for survives without them: **overdue sorts to the top** of the
 * owing list (see `outstandingRows`), every row in that list carries its own
 * status pill, and the section header states both counts as a sentence. The
 * reader gets the same three facts without having to switch views to find them,
 * which is the point — a filter that hides the other twenty people is a worse
 * answer to "who do I chase" than a list that ranks them.
 *
 * `settled` stays because it answers a different question, not a narrower one:
 * "did so-and-so pay". It is deliberately not the default — a screen that opens
 * on the people who *have* paid is a screen that has forgotten what it is for.
 */

/**
 * Every row that is not settled — late first, then most owed.
 *
 * ## Overdue leads, and that is the whole of what the Overdue tab did
 *
 * Sorting on the amount alone buried the people the hostel is actually losing
 * money on: a resident three weeks late for NPR 4,000 sat below four residents
 * who are merely unpaid for NPR 9,000 and not yet due. Late is a phone call
 * today and the others are a reminder next week, so late goes first and the
 * amount ranks within each block.
 *
 * Overdue is read from `displayStatus`, not from the due date. The server owns
 * the grace period, and comparing `dueDate` to `Date.now()` here would produce a
 * second, quieter definition that disagrees with the portal on the days either
 * side of the boundary.
 *
 * ## `NOT_BILLED` stays in
 *
 * The obvious filter is "rows with an unpaid invoice", and it hides the worst
 * case: a resident nobody billed at all. Nothing is chasing that, and nothing
 * will — no invoice means no due date, no dunning, no reminder. It sorts to the
 * bottom on amount (it owes nothing yet), which is why the screen also states
 * the count in the section header.
 *
 * ## Ties break on the name
 *
 * Several residents owing exactly one month's rent is the normal case, not an
 * edge case, so without a tiebreak the list reshuffles on every refresh and the
 * row somebody was reaching for moves under their thumb.

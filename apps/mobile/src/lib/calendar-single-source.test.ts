/**
 * The calendar preference has one source, and this is what keeps it that way.
 *
 * The node types are referenced explicitly because Expo's base tsconfig does not
 * load them — this is the only test here that reads the source tree rather than
 * calling into it.
 *
 * ## Why a test that reads the source tree
 *
 * `uiSlice.calendarPreference` decides whether the app spells dates in Bikram
 * Sambat or Gregorian. It reaches screens through `useDates()`, which is the
 * *only* correct way to render a date anywhere under `app/` — and nothing
 * stopped a screen from importing `formatDate` from `lib/format.ts` instead,
 * which silently prints Gregorian for ever.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. The statement screen printed one month twice in two
 * calendars on the same card, and `manage/statements.tsx` printed the raw
 * `2026-09` period key beside a formatted date. Both passed review and both
 * typechecked, because there is nothing about either a type can catch.
 *
 * So the rule is checked mechanically. The checks are deliberately crude — they
 * read imports, not semantics — because a crude check that runs on every commit
 * beats a precise one nobody writes.

 * owner's alone. Now the default is Bikram Sambat for everybody, so a resident's
 * Payments screen, a cook's photo log and a guardian's dashboard are all bound by
 * the same rule — see `hooks/use-dates.ts`.
 *
 * `components/` is walked too, and not as an afterthought: a shared card is the
 * one place a Gregorian date would leak into every role at once.

/**
 * One viewer for every asset in the app.
 *
 * Tapping a payment proof, a food photo, a complaint attachment, a hostel
 * exterior or a community image all open the same full-screen surface. Before
 * this, each screen either did nothing on tap (most of them) or would have grown
 * its own modal — and a per-screen viewer is how you end up with pinch-to-zoom
 * on one image and not on the next one, and with the private-asset header
 * remembered in four places out of five.
 *
 * ## Why a plain module rather than context or Redux
 *
 * Same reasoning as `lib/upload-queue.ts`. Screens open the viewer from event
 * handlers, list rows and gesture callbacks, and threading a dispatch through
 * every one of those means every call site takes a prop it does not otherwise
 * need. It is also state with no meaning after a relaunch, so it must not reach
 * `redux-persist`.
 *
 * ## Public and private assets are not the same fetch
 *
 * A `PUBLIC` asset (hostel photos, community media) is a plain URL a bare
 * `<Image>` can follow. A `PRIVATE` one — payment proof, ID photo, complaint
 * attachment — is served by `files/[assetId]/url`, which authorises the caller
 * and 302s to R2, so it needs the bearer token on **our** route and must never
 * carry one to the redirect target (see `privateAssetSource` for the measured
 * reason). Getting that wrong renders a blank square, so the choice is made once
 * here rather than at each call site.
 *
 * Kept free of React Native so the decisions can be tested; the overlay is
 * `components/asset-viewer.tsx` and holds only presentation.

/**
 * The resident's statement — every rupee that has actually left them, newest
 * first.
 *
 * The mirror of `lib/hostel-statement.ts`, and deliberately thin: everything
 * that filters, searches, groups, ranges or totals a statement lives there and
 * is shared through `StatementRow`. What is here is the part that is genuinely
 * per-side — building rows out of *resident* invoices, and the words.
 *
 * Pure and free of the axios client, same rule as its sibling: Vitest runs
 * node-side with no React Native shim, so the part worth testing is kept out of
 * the screen. `app/(resident)/statement.tsx` is a renderer over these functions.
 *
 * ## Debits only, and it is the same product decision read backwards
 *
 * The hostel's statement is credits because a hostel does not spend through this
 * product. A resident does not *collect* through it either — nobody pays rent to
 * a resident — so their statement is the other single column: money out. An
 * invoice earns a row when `paidAmount > 0` and for no other reason, every
 * amount is a debit, and the direction marker is a constant rather than
 * something to read.
 *
 * An invoice that is merely *raised* is therefore absent, which is the whole
 * difference between this and the Payments tab. Payments answers "what do I owe
 * and how do I pay it"; this answers "what have I actually paid, and when". A
 * resident asked the second question by a parent, a guardian or a landlord, and
 * the Payments tab made them read a list of open months to answer it.
 *
 * ## One invoice is one debit, not one payment
 *
 * The finance view serves invoices, so a month paid in two instalments appears
 * once, at the paid amount, dated by the **last** settlement — `paidDate` is a
 * single field. The detail sheet says `NPR 3,000 of NPR 5,000` in that case
 * rather than implying the month is closed. Same trade the hostel's side takes,
 * for the same reason: inventing two rows out of one would be inventing data.
 *
 * ## There is no truncation here
 *
 * The hostel ledger caps at 5,000 invoices and hides its running totals when it
 * hits that. A resident's own history is a row a month, so the whole of it
 * always arrives and every running total is real.
 *
 * ## Every function that spells a date takes the calendar
 *
 * The resident portal has the same calendar preference the admin one does
 * (`uiSlice.calendarPreference`, through `hooks/use-dates.ts`), so `calendar` is
 * a required argument rather than one defaulting to `"AD"` — a default is
 * exactly how a new call site keeps printing Gregorian while every row around it
 * has moved.

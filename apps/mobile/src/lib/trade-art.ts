/**
 * A flat vector character per trade, and the colours their card is drawn in.
 *
 * ## Why inline SVG and not an icon or an image file
 *
 * The owner asked for cards carrying pictures of the tradespeople — a plumber, a
 * doctor — rather than eleven variations of the same grey glyph. An Ionicons
 * wrench is not a plumber, and there are no illustration assets in this repo to
 * reach for.
 *
 * `react-native-svg` would be the obvious answer and is **not installed**, and
 * adding it is a native module: the dev build already on the phone would not
 * have it, and every JS reload would crash until the APK was rebuilt. `expo-image`
 * already renders SVG on both platforms (androidsvg on Android, the SVG coder on
 * iOS) and is already a dependency, so a `data:` URI costs nothing to ship and
 * works in the build that is installed today.
 *
 * ## Composed, not eleven hand-drawn blobs
 *
 * Every figure is the same bust — a tinted disc, a head, hair, shoulders — with
 * the trade's own uniform colour and one prop. That is what keeps the deck
 * looking like one set rather than eleven clip-art downloads, and it is why
 * adding a twelfth trade is three lines rather than an illustration brief.
 *
 * ## About the colour
 *
 * `docs/DESIGN.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are emphatic that the app is black, white and
 * green, and these cards are the one deliberate exception, asked for directly on
 * 2026-09-02: *"colourful card swappable"*. The colour is confined to the
 * **illustration and its card tint** — it is doing the job of an illustration,
 * which is to be recognised at a glance from across a corridor. Every control on
 * the card, the selected state included, is still `--primary`, so nothing here
 * competes with the brand for meaning. Do not spread these hexes to chrome.
 *
 * Pure: string building and a lookup table, no React Native, so it is testable
 * node-side like every other `lib/` module.

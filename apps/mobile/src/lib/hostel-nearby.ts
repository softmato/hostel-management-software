/**
 * Grouping the places around a hostel, the way the website's Location panel
 * groups them.
 *
 * Pure and free of React Native imports so it can be tested node-side, and so
 * `components/hostel-map.tsx` can reach `nearbyGlyph` from inside the string it
 * builds for the WebView.
 *
 * ## The order is a judgement, not an alphabet
 *
 * Ported from `NEARBY_GROUPS` in `public-hostel-detail-page.tsx`, in the same
 * order: colleges, hospitals, pharmacies, bus stops, restaurants, parks, gyms.
 * That order is roughly "what decides whether you take the room" — a student
 * picks a hostel by how far the campus is and worries about the gym later — and
 * on a phone it matters more than on the web, because the reader sees the first
 * two groups and scrolls for the rest.
 *
 * ## Types outside the table are kept, not dropped
 *
 * The server's `type` is a free string from the cached OpenStreetMap lookup
 * (`lib/maps/nearby.ts`), so it can carry a category this table has never heard
 * of. Those land in a trailing group named from the type itself rather than
 * being discarded: a hostel next door to something useful should not lose it
 * because the client's list is a version behind the geocoder's.

 * page with no access to the Ionicons font the rest of the app loads — the
 * alternatives were inlining an SVG path per category into the generated string,
 * or shipping a font file to a page that already needs a network for its tiles.

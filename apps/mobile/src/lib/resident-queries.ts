/**
 * Every read the resident portal makes, named once.
 *
 * The sibling of `admin-queries.ts`, built for the same two reasons and a third
 * that turned out to matter more here than there.
 *
 * ## 1. A prefetch has to warm the key the screen reads
 *
 * Otherwise it warms a key nobody looks at and the screen loads twice. That
 * requires the loader and its key to be defined in one place both the warm-up
 * and the screen can import — which is this file.
 *
 * ## 2. The identity guarantee
 *
 * `defineQuery` hands back the *same* descriptor object for the life of the
 * process, so `query.load` is a stable identity and needs no `useCallback` at
 * the call site. `useResource` refetches whenever its loader's identity changes,
 * so a registry returning a fresh arrow each render would fetch in a loop.
 *
 * ## 3. The resident tabs were throwing their answers away
 *
 * This is the part that was actually broken. `useResource` without a `cacheKey`
 * holds its payload in component state and loses it on unmount — the correct
 * default for a screen visited once, and the wrong one for a tab. Every resident
 * screen was in that state, so switching Home → Payments → Home refetched the
 * dashboard from scratch, with a loading state, every single time. The admin
 * tabs have painted from cache since they got their registry; these now do too.
 *
 * ## The warm-up is one wave, not the admin's three
 *
 * `prefetchAdminPortal` splits into three tiers because a warden's portal has
 * seven reads at the door and a dozen more behind it. A resident has **five
 * tabs and one payload each**, four of which are small, so a second wave would
 * be scheduling machinery around nothing. What is deliberately *not* warmed:
 *
 * - **Home**, because the resident lands on it and it is already asking. Warming
 *   it would be a duplicate request racing the screen's own.
 * - **Anything per-id** — an invoice, a complaint, a guardian. Warming forty
 *   records to save one tap is bandwidth taken from the screen on the glass.
 * - **Community**, which has `prefetchCommunity` of its own and is shared with
 *   every other role.

/**
 * What the platform is doing with a service provider's application, in words.
 *
 * ## Why this is one file and not five strings
 *
 * The same five states are reported in four places — the Profile tab of the
 * browsing shell, the "Become a service provider" landing screen, the wizard's
 * confirmation, and the provider's own card once they are in — and until this
 * file they were written out separately in each. They had already drifted:
 * the landing screen told applicants that jobs are "broadcast by hostels in your
 * trades and area", which is a marketplace this product deliberately does not
 * have (`lib/provider-api.ts` and PHASES.md §6.1 both say so), while the card
 * tab told an applicant with no record to "apply from the website" months after
 * `service-providers/apply` shipped.
 *
 * A status is a promise about what happens next. Four copies of a promise is
 * four chances to make a different one.
 *
 * ## Pure, and therefore tested
 *
 * No React and no API client, so Vitest can run it — the same reason
 * `provider-jobs.ts` sits beside `provider-api.ts` rather than inside it.

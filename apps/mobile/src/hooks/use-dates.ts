/**
 * Every date in the app, already in the calendar the reader chose.
 *
 * ## Why a hook rather than a module-level switch
 *
 * The tempting shortcut is a mutable `activeCalendar` inside `lib/format.ts`,
 * set once at boot, so no call site has to change. It does not work: React
 * re-renders on state, and a module variable is not state — the owner would flip
 * the setting, walk back to Money, and find August still spelled in English
 * until the screen happened to remount for some other reason. Reading the
 * preference through `useAppSelector` is what makes the change land everywhere
 * on the same frame.
 *
 * ## The names are short on purpose
 *
 * `dates.date(row.createdAt)` rather than `formatDateIn(calendar, …)` at a
 * hundred call sites. The bundle is memoised on the preference, so the identity is
 * stable across renders and it is safe in a `useMemo` dependency list — which
 * matters, because several admin screens build their row text inside one.
 *
 * ## Scope: every screen, every role
 *
 * This started as an admin-only hook, on the argument that the calendar was the
 * hostel's bookkeeping choice and a resident should not inherit it. That was
 * backwards. The preference is **stored on this phone**, not on the hostel — it
 * describes the person holding it, the same way the theme does — so there was
 * never a resident inheriting an owner's setting to worry about. What actually
 * happened was that a resident opened Payments and read a rent month in a
 * calendar they do not keep, in a country where Bikram Sambat is the civil one.
 *
 * So the rule now: **any screen that draws a date calls `useDates()`.** Resident,
 * guardian, cook, service provider, store, admin and the shared screens all go
 * through here, and `lib/calendar-single-source.test.ts` fails the build for a
 * screen under `app/` that reaches past it into `lib/format`.
 *
 * The exceptions are listed in that test, and each is a date that genuinely has
 * no calendar to choose: a `YYYY-MM-DD` field someone types into, a chart axis
 * whose labels only need to differ from each other, and the statement export,
 * which prints both calendars because it leaves the app.

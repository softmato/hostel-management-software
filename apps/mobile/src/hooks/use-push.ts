/**
 * Push registration, tap routing, the app-icon badge — and the one push that
 * changes what app this is.
 *
 * Mounted once, at the root. Everything is keyed to the signed-in account:
 * registration re-runs when the account changes, because the `DeviceToken` row
 * belongs to a user id and a shared phone must not keep delivering person A's
 * alerts to person B.
 *
 * The exception to "a push opens a screen" is `marksRoleChange`: being
 * registered at a hostel promotes the recipient's own account, and that push is
 * handled in both directions — tapped, and merely received while the app is
 * open. See `adoptRoleChange`.

   * Responses already routed. The cold-start replay below and the live listener

   * invoice screen twice — leaving a duplicate in the back stack that the user
   * has to dismiss twice.
   *
   * ## Why the key is not the identifier alone
   *
   * It was, and it broke every download after the first. A *server* push gets a
   * fresh identifier per message, so an identifier looked like a per-response
   * key — but the app's own notifications are posted under a deliberately
   * constant one (`UPLOAD_NOTIFICATION_ID`), because each progress update has to
   * *replace* the last rather than stack. So every download the app has ever
   * reported shares a single identifier, and this set never empties: the first
   * tap opened the file, and every tap afterwards was dropped as a duplicate.
   *
   * The cold-start replay made it worse than "once per session". It marks that
   * constant id handled before the user has tapped anything, so the first real
   * tap of a session was usually dead too — which is exactly what a tap that
   * does nothing at all looks like from the outside.
   *
   * `date` is when the notification was delivered, so it differs per post and
   * matches for the two surfacings of one response — which is the only thing
   * this set was ever meant to catch.

/**
 * "Near me", as a piece of screen state.
 *
 * Owns the permission dance and the one reading, and nothing else — the sorting
 * itself is `sortByDistance` in `lib/geo.ts`, which is pure and tested.
 *
 * ## The coordinate lives here and dies here
 *
 * It is `useState`, not Redux. Redux is persisted by `redux-persist`, so a
 * coordinate dispatched into it would be written to the device's disk and kept
 * across launches — that is a location history, not a sort key. Unmount the
 * screen and the position is gone, which is the correct lifetime for something
 * used to order a list.
 *
 * ## Every failure keeps the screen working
 *
 * Denied, blocked, services off, no fix in eight seconds: all of them turn the
 * toggle back off and leave the list exactly as the server sorted it, with a
 * message saying why. The one thing this must never do is leave a spinner on a
 * list that was already usable.
 *
 * ## `auto`, and why it is not simply "ask on mount"
 *
 * The home screen's Nearby row asked the reader to press a button before it
 * would show anything, which meant the section was empty for everybody who did
 * not — a heading, a paragraph and a button where the design has hostels. With
 * `auto` the row fills itself instead, under the policy in `lib/location.ts`:
 * silently when permission is already granted, and with **one** dialogue on an
 * install that has never seen it. A refusal is remembered, so this cannot become
 * a prompt at every app start; the button stays for anyone who changes their
 * mind, and `blocked` still points at Settings.
 *
 * The automatic attempt is **silent**: it raises no toast. A toast is a reply to
 * something the reader did, and nobody did anything here — the section says what
 * happened in its own words, in place.
 *
 * ## And it re-reads on every focus, because a distance goes stale
 *
 * A position taken when the screen first mounted is the distance from wherever
 * the phone was that morning. So an `auto` screen refreshes on each focus —
 * `getLastKnownPositionAsync` first, so the usual cost is no fix at all — and
 * the refresh **keeps the coordinates it has** until a new one arrives: status
 * never drops back to `locating` once it is `ready`, or the row would flash a
 * skeleton every time the reader came back from a hostel page.

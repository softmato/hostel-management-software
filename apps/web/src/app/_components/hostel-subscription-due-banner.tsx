/**
 * "Please pay this much within N days" — the due a team registration leaves
 * behind.
 *
 * ## Why it is a banner and not a page
 *
 * A hostel in this state is **live**. Its listing is up, students can find it,
 * and it is being run day to day by somebody who did not necessarily make the
 * payment arrangement — the owner met an agent once and an amount was agreed.
 * So the reminder has to be somewhere they cannot miss on the way to doing
 * something else, which is the top of every screen.
 *
 * ## The button opens a checkout; it never records a payment
 *
 * `Pay now` hands the owner to Softmato checkout (`checkout-handoff`), and the
 * money is confirmed by Softmato's webhook or the return page's server-side
 * read. **A browser cannot record a payment** — an earlier version of this
 * button "confirmed" one on a second press, and told the owner so.
 *
 * ## It knows when a claim is already in review
 *
 * A balance stays outstanding while we are checking a proof, so without this
 * the banner would keep asking an owner who paid this morning to pay again.
 *
 * ## Why it cannot be dismissed permanently
 *
 * Closing it hides it for the session and no longer. A due with a deadline that
 * a hostel could switch off is a due nobody pays; the dismissal exists so
 * somebody can get through one piece of work without it in the way, not so they
 * can decide never to see it.
 *
 * ## It renders nothing in every other state
 *
 * A hostel that paid in full, one that predates plan billing, one whose
 * registration is still public and unpublished — all of them get no banner at
 * all. Only `PAST_DUE` with money actually outstanding produces one.

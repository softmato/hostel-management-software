 * Paying the platform from the portal: one button that hands the owner to
 * Softmato checkout and brings them back to the return page.
 *
 * ## It renders nothing unless something is owed
 *
 * Most owners are paid up, and a payment panel on a settled account is an
 * invitation to pay twice. It appears when there is an outstanding balance.
 *
 * ## A proof already sent still gets its answer
 *
 * The QR-and-screenshot lane this replaced may have left a claim in review.
 * That owner is told it is being checked and is not offered a second way to
 * pay the same money.
 *
 * Nothing here can record a payment: Softmato confirms it, by a signed webhook
 * or by the server-side read the return page makes.

/**
 * The shell the two payment flows open in — *Pay now* and *Submit proof*.
 *
 * **Why a modal and not the inline panel they used to be.** Both flows were
 * sections spliced into the middle of Fees & Payments, which put them below the
 * focus card and above four metric tiles and a history table. Three problems, all
 * of them layout rather than content:
 *
 * 1. **They opened off-screen.** Tapping `Pay now` on a phone injected a panel
 *    where the page happened to be scrolled, so the commonest outcome was a
 *    screen that visibly reflowed and appeared to do nothing.
 * 2. **The page competed with the step.** A resident copying a reference code
 *    into a banking app was doing it beside an outstanding total, a status
 *    filter and every month they had ever paid.
 * 3. **Neither had a bottom.** The submit button sat wherever the form ended,
 *    with the metric tiles immediately beneath it.
 *
 * A modal fixes all three by construction: it is centred wherever they are, it
 * dims what is not the step, and it has an edge to pin the action to.
 *
 * **Header, scroll, footer.** The header carries the one-line answer to *what am
 * I doing and for how much*, and stays put. Only the middle scrolls. The footer
 * holds the action and is likewise fixed, so the button is reachable on a phone
 * without scrolling past a receipt preview to find it.
 *
 * Closing is deliberately ordinary — backdrop, escape, the X — because both
 * flows are abandonable at any point and nothing is lost by leaving.

/**
 * The three ways a payment profile can leave us unable to check a receipt.
 *
 * `NO_METHOD` is the obvious failure: nothing is set, so the resident pay screen
 * has nothing to render and residents cannot pay at all. It is loud and it is
 * not dismissible — dismissing it would hide the reason the hostel is collecting
 * no money.
 *
 * `QR_UNREAD` is the interesting one, and it is narrow on purpose. A QR poster
 * prints the account name and number beside the code, so uploading one normally
 * *is* setting a credential — `readQrPayee` lifts it at upload and the hostel is
 * verifiable without typing anything. This fires only when that read came back
 * empty: a dark photo of a standee, an unusual layout, a recogniser that could
 * not run. The hostel is collecting money perfectly well; we just cannot yet
 * recognise it on the receipts coming back, and two fields fix it.
 *
 * `NO_CREDENTIAL` is the same gap reached without a QR at all — a hostel with a
 * gateway and no account details.

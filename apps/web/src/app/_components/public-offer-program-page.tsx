/**
 * The public explainer for the Resident Offer Program.
 *
 * **Public, and deliberately so.** Every other surface that mentions the
 * programme is behind a login, but the two moments a resident most wants to read
 * about it are moments they are not logged in: the confirmation email that lands
 * seconds after they submit a payment proof, and the conversation with a parent
 * or guardian who is paying the rent and has no account at all.
 *
 * **The same shell as the legal pages**, on purpose. This is a page of plain
 * answers to plain questions, and the privacy/terms layout is what the site
 * already uses for that. It is not a landing page and should not grow into one
 * here — a deeper treatment is later work.
 *
 * The copy answers, in order, the four things residents actually ask: what it is,
 * what to do, what they get, and why the receipt cannot be reused. The last one
 * is not decoration — residents have tried to re-submit an issued receipt as
 * proof of a later payment, and telling them plainly why that does not work is
 * cheaper than the rejection it otherwise becomes.
 *
 * That copy now lives in the site config under `content.offerProgram`, because
 * the app shows the same explainer and a resident must not be able to read two
 * different accounts of how their rent is matched.

/**
 * The apply block — the one part of this page that is not the same for everyone.
 *
 * Three states, and the distinction that matters is the third: a signed-in user
 * who is not a resident. Showing them "Apply" would send them to a portal they
 * cannot open, and showing them the signed-out pitch would tell them to create an
 * account they already have. Both are dead ends, and both are what a two-state
 * check produces.
 *
 * `status === "unknown"` renders the block disabled rather than absent. The
 * session resolves a beat after first paint, and a button that appears late moves
 * the page under whoever was already reading it — worse than one that is briefly
 * inert.
 *
 * **Apply routes into the portal rather than writing anything.** Eligibility is a
 * property of being a resident with invoices, which is already true or already
 * false by the time anyone reads this page; there is no approval to grant. The
 * button takes an eligible resident to the screen where their code lives and
 * where the programme is actually used.

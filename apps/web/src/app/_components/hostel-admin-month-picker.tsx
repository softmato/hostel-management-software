/**
 * A month field inside a form, in the calendar this product bills in.
 *
 * ## Why `<input type="month">` had to go, and could not be patched
 *
 * The control has no Bikram Sambat mode. It is the browser's own widget, it
 * renders the host platform's Gregorian calendar, and the value it emits is a
 * Gregorian `YYYY-MM`. That string then went to the server as an
 * `Invoice.period` — which is now a **BS** month — so an owner picking
 * "September 2026" in the billing dialog was asking to bill `2026-09`: a period
 * fifty-seven years before anything the hostel has ever billed. The run came
 * back having issued nothing, and nothing on the screen said why.
 *
 * This is not a formatting problem with a formatting fix. A month input cannot
 * express Bhadra, so the input is replaced rather than relabelled.
 *
 * ## An identity, not a label
 *
 * The value posted is the period key itself. The list is built with
 * `addBsMonths`, which is the same arithmetic the server steps months with, so
 * the string in the form is the string the server keys invoices by — including
 * across a BS year end, where the month after `2083-12` is `2084-01` and not
 * `2083-13`.
 *
 * ## Why the Gregorian dates are on the row and not only the month name
 *
 * `Bhadra 2083 BS` alone asks an owner to know from memory which fortnight of
 * which English month it starts in, and the bank statement they are reconciling
 * against is in that other calendar. So each row carries the span it covers —
 * `17 Aug – 16 Sep 2026` — and the BS month leads, because the money is BS. That
 * is the same rule the mobile app follows: BS leads where a date is money, AD is
 * the translation beside it.
 *
 * A hidden input carries the value so `new FormData(form)` reads it exactly as
 * it read the input this replaces; no submit handler needed changing.

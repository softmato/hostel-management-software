/**
 * The plan marks.
 *
 * One drawing in three states rather than three unrelated icons: a roof, and
 * the residents under it. The roof and all three rows sit at the same place in
 * every mark — what changes is how many rows are filled in, so the three cards
 * read left to right as one house getting fuller, which is exactly what the
 * price is buying.
 *
 * Rows are fixed rather than added because a mark that grows also *moves*: draw
 * only the rows a plan has and Go becomes a small chevron floating in an empty
 * box while Max fills it, and the three cards stop lining up. Faint rows keep
 * every mark the same size and turn the empty space into headroom, which is
 * what the plan above is selling.
 *
 * Drawn on one 40×40 grid at one stroke weight in `currentColor`, so it takes
 * the card's own colour and stays sharp at any size. Deliberately not a Lucide
 * import — no stock icon says "more people under one roof".

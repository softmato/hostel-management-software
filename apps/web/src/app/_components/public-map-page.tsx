/**
 * The whole catalogue on one map: search, pick, and find the way.
 *
 * ## It is not the browse page's map, and the difference matters
 *
 * `/hostels` plots the rows a set of filters produced — type, facility, budget,
 * city — and is a view onto a *result set*. This is the whole catalogue,
 * searched by name and place, and it is the only page that routes. Merging them
 * would mean one screen whose pins mean different things depending on how it was
 * opened.
 *
 * ## Everything on it is the platform's own catalogue
 *
 * Pins, results and the panel are all `/public/hostels` — the same payload the
 * browse page renders. There is no place search, no geocoder and no third-party
 * POI layer: a map that finds "hostels near Baneshwor" and offers you one that
 * is not on the platform is a map that sends people somewhere the app cannot
 * help them. Searching narrows what is already here.
 *
 * ## It reads like Google Maps, not like the phone screen scaled up
 *
 * A full-viewport map with floating panels over it: the search card top-left,
 * one panel under it that changes contents — results, then the hostel, then
 * directions, then the guidance card — and the controls stacked on the right.
 * Below `md` the panel becomes a bottom sheet, which is what Google Maps itself
 * does on a narrow window.
 *
 * ## What a browser cannot do, it says
 *
 * Rotation needs a compass and a laptop has none, so on a desktop the map stays
 * north-up, the compass control reads `—` and nothing looks broken. Geolocation
 * needs a secure context, and where there is none the panel says so rather than
 * leaving Start to fail as "no position". See `WEB_MAP_PLAN.md` §4.2.

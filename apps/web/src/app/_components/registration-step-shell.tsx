/**
 * The calm one-section-at-a-time shell the public registration form wears.
 *
 * ## What it takes from the reference, and what it does not
 *
 * The reference flow is a vertical rail of named steps on the left and a single
 * card on the right that fades, lifts and sharpens as you move between them.
 * That layout is worth copying: it keeps the whole journey visible while asking
 * exactly one thing at a time, which is what makes a long form feel short.
 *
 * What is not copied is its palette. The reference is a warm off-white with its
 * own green; this uses `--brand-teal` on `--surface` like every other screen
 * here, because a registration form that looked like a different product than
 * the dashboard behind it would be the least trustworthy thing on the site.
 *
 * The motion is also deliberately quieter — see the note over `@keyframes
 * step-in` in `globals.css` for why the blur, travel and marker overshoot were
 * all reduced.
 *
 * ## Steps are named, not numbered
 *
 * The rail shows what each step is *for* ("Where it is", "Rooms and pricing")
 * rather than "Step 3". A number tells somebody how much is left; a name tells
 * them what they are about to be asked, which is the thing that lets them
 * decide whether they have the paperwork to hand.

 * Replays the entrance animation whenever the step changes.
 *
 * Keyed remounting would do the same thing in one line, but it would also throw
 * away the DOM of every field in the section — and with it any uncommitted
 * value, focus, or in-flight upload sitting inside. Re-running the animation on
 * a stable subtree keeps the movement and leaves the contents alone.

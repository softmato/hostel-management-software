/**
 * The Resident Offer Program — one name, one promise, said the same way
 * everywhere on Fees & Payments.
 *
 * **What it actually is:** the reference code, given a reason the resident cares
 * about. Everything downstream of a payment depends on the code travelling with
 * it — statement matching, auto-settlement, an owner's queue that is not full of
 * transfers nobody can attribute — and none of that is the resident's problem.
 * "Your payment is harder for us to match" is our problem stated as their
 * obligation, and people ignore it. A programme they stay in by quoting a code
 * they already have is a reason of their own, and it buys exactly the behaviour
 * that makes reconciliation possible.
 *
 * **Why one module rather than a paragraph per screen.** The programme is
 * mentioned at five different moments — the page banner, the pay screen, before
 * the upload, and the two answers after it — and a promise that is worded
 * slightly differently each time is not a promise, it is marketing. The states
 * live in one union here so the name, the tone and the instruction cannot drift
 * apart, and adding a sixth moment is a case in this file rather than a fresh
 * invention on a screen.
 *
 * **Never a gate, in any state.** A resident whose bank strips the remarks field
 * has still paid their rent. The worst thing any of these says is "next time".

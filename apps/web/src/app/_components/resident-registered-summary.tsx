/**
 * What was just agreed at the desk, while the resident is still standing there.
 *
 * ## The reference code has one moment, and this is it
 *
 * Registering somebody raises up to two invoices, each with a reference code the
 * resident is supposed to quote on their transfer. Everything downstream depends
 * on it — statement matching, auto-settlement, the owner's review queue not
 * filling with money nobody can attribute — and it was shown nowhere. The intake
 * ended in a one-line toast, the codes existed only in the database and in an
 * email the resident may not read for a day, and by the time they paid there was
 * nothing to quote. So the codes are printed here, monospaced and one tap to
 * copy, at the one moment the person who owes the money is in the room.
 *
 * ## And how to pay, on the same screen
 *
 * The hostel's own methods come back with the registration
 * (`getHostelPayMethods`), rendered through the same components as the
 * resident's checkout — a warden reading out an eSewa id must be reading the
 * same id the resident's portal will show them.
 *
 * ## Pay later is a real answer, not a dismissal
 *
 * Most residents do not pay at the desk: they transfer that evening, or their
 * guardian does. Closing this without paying is therefore the ordinary path and
 * is labelled as such — the invoices stay open, the codes stay valid, and the
 * resident settles from their own portal. The alternative, an unlabelled close
 * button, reads as "cancel" over money that has already been billed.

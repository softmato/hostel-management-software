 * Reading the plans-and-pricing catalogue, on the website.
 *
 * Neither the data nor the arithmetic lives here any more. The catalogue is the
 * `plans` section of the site config — authored in Platform → Website Config →
 * Plans & Pricing, shipped as `plans.defaults.ts` — and the functions that read
 * it are `@hostel/shared/plans/catalog`, so the app computes the same prices
 * from the same rules. This file is the seam between the two: it re-exports
 * that arithmetic under the names this app already used, and it names the types
 * from the zod schema rather than the structural ones, so a change to the
 * schema is a type error here rather than a surprise at runtime.
 *
 * Every function takes the catalogue as an argument rather than closing over a
 * constant, because two surfaces render it: the public page against the saved
 * config, and the admin editor against an unsaved draft.

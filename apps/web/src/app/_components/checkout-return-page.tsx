/**
 * Where every platform payment lands after Softmato checkout — or after not
 * paying.
 *
 * ## The steps are real
 *
 * The server streams each stage as it starts: confirming the payment with
 * Softmato, recording it, then reading back what was switched on. A payer who
 * has just handed over money watches that happen instead of a spinner, and the
 * last line is read from the plan or booking itself — not assumed.
 *
 * ## Nothing on this page is read from the URL
 *
 * The address carries our own reference (`invoice` for a plan, `booking` for a
 * booking) and nothing else. It is a navigation hint, and the answer comes from
 * a server-side call to Softmato made after ownership is checked. Softmato puts
 * no payment status in that URL, and anything resembling one did not come
 * from them.
 *
 * ## It re-checks while Softmato has not answered
 *
 * The browser usually beats the server-to-server webhook home, so a document
 * not raised yet is asked about again for a short while rather than shown as a
 * finished state.

/**
 * Plan billing, from the platform's side of the table.
 *
 * ## Two tables, not one merged ledger
 *
 * An invoice and a payment are different objects with different lifecycles —
 * one obligation can carry several instalments — and flattening them into a
 * single feed would mean either repeating the invoice on every payment row or
 * losing which payment cleared which demand. So they are two lists under one
 * set of totals, switched by a tab, and the invoice number is the join a reader
 * makes by eye.
 *
 * ## The "issued by" column is the point of this screen right now
 *
 * Softmato is the issuer of record and is down, so we are printing the
 * documents. Every invoice therefore says which side produced the page the
 * hostel is holding, and the metric row counts them. When they come back this
 * column goes quiet on its own — new rows say `Softmato`, old ones keep saying
 * what was true when they were raised — and nothing has to be migrated to make
 * the history honest.
 *
 * ## Downloads go through the global downloader
 *
 * Not an `<a download>`: the document route is authenticated and returns bytes,
 * so the browser needs the session on the request and the file has to be
 * assembled before it is offered. `downloadFile` already does that with a live
 * row in the toaster, which is what every other file in this portal uses.

/**
 * Reading the uploaded screenshot, with the stages shown as they happen.
 *
 * The recogniser takes about a second on a full-size phone screenshot. A second
 * of unexplained spinner on a screen about money is a screen people back out of,
 * so the server announces each stage as it starts and this consumes them —
 * **nothing here is on a timer.** If the decode is slow, "Decoding the image" is
 * what stays on screen, because that is what is actually happening.
 *
 * Failure is silent by design. Autofill is a convenience laid over a form that
 * already worked; a resident whose screenshot could not be read should see the
 * status disappear and type the two fields, not read an error about OCR.
 *
 * **`fetch` rather than `browserApi`, deliberately.** The response is a stream of
 * stages and `browserApi` parses a single JSON envelope, so it cannot carry this.
 * The cost is its transparent 401-refresh-and-replay: if the access token expires
 * at exactly this moment the read is abandoned and the resident types the fields
 * themselves, while the submit that follows still refreshes and succeeds. Auth is
 * cookie-based, so `same-origin` credentials are all the request needs.

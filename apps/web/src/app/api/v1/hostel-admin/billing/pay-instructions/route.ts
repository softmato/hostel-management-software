/**
 * How this hostel pays us: the amount, the invoice to quote, and our QR.
 *
 * The owner-facing twin of `/team/collection-qr`, which shows a field agent the
 * same image. It carries more than the QR because the person reading it is the
 * payer rather than the collector — they need to know how much, against which
 * invoice, and whether a claim they already sent is still being looked at.
 *
 * Admin rather than staff. Every other read under `hostel-admin/billing` is a
 * history a warden may legitimately see; this one is the screen money is sent
 * from, and committing the hostel to a plan payment is not a warden's act.
 *
 * Scoped to the principal's first hostel rather than taking one from the query
 * string, exactly as the endpoints beside it are — an id in the URL would be an
 * endpoint that hands one hostel's balance to another hostel's staff.

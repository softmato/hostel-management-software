/**
 * Location lookup for the profile location picker, in both directions:
 *
 * - `?q=` — a place name, a pasted Google Maps / OSM link, or a raw `lat,lng`
 *   pair. Links are resolved server-side because following a `maps.app.goo.gl`
 *   redirect is impossible from the browser (cross-origin).
 * - `?lat=&lng=` — what address that pin sits on, so the address fields can
 *   follow the map.
 *
 * Staff-only — this is a paid upstream call, not something anonymous traffic
 * should be able to drive. The lookup itself is shared with the team
 * registration desk (`/api/v1/team/geocode`), which has its own guard.

/**
 * The whole record behind a scanned ID card.
 *
 * Sibling of `/hostel-admin/resident-lookup`, which answers "prefill this
 * registration form" and refuses everything that cannot. This one answers "who
 * is standing in front of me" and refuses almost nothing — see
 * `resident-scan.service.ts` for why that is the same endpoint twice rather
 * than one endpoint with a flag.
 *
 * ## Two capability checks, not one
 *
 * `registerResidents` is the gate: it is the grant that already governs reading
 * a resident's record, so a warden who may open the roster may scan a card.
 * `viewPayments` is asked for **separately and tolerantly**, because a warden
 * can legitimately hold the first without the second — and a door screen that
 * 403s in a corridor because the ledger was out of reach would be useless. A
 * refusal there returns the dossier with `ledger: null` and `ledgerDenied: true`,
 * which the phone prints as a line saying whose permission is missing.
 *
 * Rate limited for the same reason the lookup is: `HH-4K7M-9XQ2` is ten
 * characters out of a thirty-symbol alphabet, and an unthrottled endpoint that
 * returns somebody's blood group is a guessing game worth playing.

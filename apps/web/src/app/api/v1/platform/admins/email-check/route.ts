/**
 * Answers "is this address free?" while the superadmin is still typing it.
 *
 * Superadmin-gated like the rest of the roster, and deliberately so: an open
 * endpoint that says whether an address has an account is an account-existence
 * oracle, which is worth more to somebody enumerating a user list than it is to
 * anybody else. The people who can call it can already read the whole roster.
 *
 * A GET with the address in the query string rather than a POST, because it
 * reads and changes nothing — which is also what lets the client cancel a
 * request mid-flight as the next keystroke arrives without leaving anything
 * half-done behind it.

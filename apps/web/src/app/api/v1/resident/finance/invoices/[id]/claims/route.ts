/**
 * A resident claiming they have paid (target §11.2, plan item 2.8).
 *
 * Replaces `POST /api/v1/resident/payments/[paymentId]/proof`. A replayed submit
 * returns `200` rather than a second `201`: the idempotency key collapsed it to
 * the claim that already exists, and telling the resident "created" twice would
 * be a lie about what happened.
 *
 * **Rate-limited, and this one is about cost rather than guessing** (item E.8).
 * Every POST here can run sharp and tesseract over a full-size screenshot, which
 * is seconds of CPU — so a script looping on submit is a denial of service with
 * no forged credential and nothing to brute-force. The budget is deliberately
 * small: a resident pays rent once a month and re-uploads a blurry screenshot two
 * or three times at worst, so anything above a handful an hour is not a person.
 *
 * Applied before the body is parsed and before the principal is resolved, because
 * work done ahead of the limiter is work an attacker gets for free.

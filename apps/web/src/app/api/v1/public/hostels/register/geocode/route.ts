/**
 * The location lookup for an owner placing their own hostel on the map while
 * they apply — the third desk behind `lookupLocation`, after the hostel admin's
 * profile and the team registration form.
 *
 * The applicant has no hostel to hold a capability on and is not staff, so the
 * guard is a signed-in account (the phone's application flow already requires
 * one) plus a per-client rate limit. That keeps a paid upstream call away from
 * anonymous traffic, which is what the other two guards exist for, without
 * locking the owner out of the pin their own listing is measured from.
 *
 * Sixty a minute: a search box fires a lookup per submitted query and a reverse
 * lookup per placed pin, and an owner nudging the map onto their gate places
 * several.

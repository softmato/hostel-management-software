/**
 * Records that these hostels were shown in a result list.
 *
 * Split out of `GET /public/hostels`, which used to count inside the read. That
 * welded the counting to the serving: the moment the list carries a
 * `Cache-Control` header, a CDN hit answers the visitor without ever reaching
 * our code, and the appearance is never recorded. The owner's "Seen in search"
 * tile would have drifted further from the truth the more traffic the site got
 * — worst exactly when it starts to matter.
 *
 * Counting from the client instead means the CDN can cache the list as hard as
 * it likes. This is the same shape `POST /public/hostels/[slug]/views` already
 * uses for the "Page views" tile beside it.
 *
 * **It trades one inaccuracy for another, and that is the deal.** A blocked
 * beacon undercounts, where a cached response undercounted before — but this
 * error is roughly a constant fraction of real visitors instead of one that
 * grows with traffic.

 * with a `mealsCovered` count per day rather than being a flat list they have to
 * count themselves.
 *
 * Same role list as the POST: a cook sees their own kitchen's feed, and a
 * hostel admin or warden looking at it sees the hostel they are scoped to.
 * `hostelId` is honoured for the admin case, where a principal can hold several
 * — `resolveCookHostelId` asserts access either way, so it is not a way to read

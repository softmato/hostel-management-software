/**
 * "Can this owner email be used?" — asked while the field agent is still typing.
 *
 * An email already tied to a live hostel cannot be used for another one, and
 * the registration itself refuses it (`assertTeamRegistrationIsNew`). This is
 * the same answer given early, so the agent learns it at the email field with
 * the owner still in front of them — not six steps later at Publish, after the
 * photos and the rooms are in.
 *
 * Team-gated, for the reason the superadmin's own email check is gated: an open
 * endpoint that says whether an address belongs to a hostel is a lookup worth
 * more to someone enumerating owners than to anyone else. Field agents register
 * hostels for a living and already see who owns what.
 *
 * Returns the hostel's name, not its id or owner — enough for the agent to say
 * "that address is on Everest Home" and no more.

/**
 * The eSewa hand-off relay.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * eSewa's checkout is a signed **form POST**, and a phone can only open URLs.
 * `expo-web-browser` and `Linking.openURL` both take a URL; Chrome refuses to
 * navigate to a `data:` URL carrying a self-submitting form; and re-signing the
 * fields on the client would put the merchant secret on a handset. So the app
 * opens this page instead, and the page carries the form. The secret stays on
 * the server and the *resident's* browser is still what arrives at eSewa, which
 * is the requirement that made `FORM_POST` a handoff kind in the first place.
 *
 * The web portal does not use this — it holds the fields already and posts them
 * itself. This page exists for clients that cannot.
 *
 * ## Why it submits itself but still shows a button
 *
 * The auto-submit is the happy path: nobody wants an interstitial. But a page
 * whose only way forward is a script is a dead end the moment the script does
 * not run — a stricter browser, a slow connection cut mid-load, a WebView with
 * JS disabled — and the dead end would be in the middle of paying rent. The
 * button is the fallback, and it is a real submit control on a real form, not a
 * second code path.
 *
 * ## No session, deliberately
 *
 * The browser this opens in has no app session; that is the problem being
 * solved. `buildFormPostHandoff` is what bounds the exposure — `CREATED` only,
 * unexpired only, and nothing on the page but an amount and a merchant form.

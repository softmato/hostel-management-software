/**
 * `/resident-offer-program` — its own route, outside the `(public)` group.
 *
 * Standalone because it is not part of the marketing site: it is the page a
 * payment email points a resident at, and the one link a guardian who has no
 * account can be sent. The site configuration it reads comes from the root
 * layout, so it renders correctly without the public group's wrapper.
 *
 * UI follows the legal pages (privacy, terms) for now — plain sections of plain
 * answers, which is what this content is. A fuller treatment is later work.

/**
 * Telling a resident that a bill they are already holding has changed.
 *
 * ## Why this is not optional
 *
 * `rate-card-notify` exists because an owner editing the rate card used to change
 * what somebody pays silently, and the resident found out when an invoice arrived
 * for a number they had not agreed to. A festival discount applied **after** the
 * month was billed is the same failure pointed the other way: the bill in their
 * hand said 8,000, our copy now says 4,000, and nothing told them which is real.
 * A resident who pays the 8,000 they were asked for then overpays by half a
 * month, and a resident who happens to open the app pays 4,000 — the same month,
 * the same hostel, two different answers depending on whether somebody looked.
 *
 * Good news needs saying as much as bad. It is also the thing the hostel most
 * wants said: the discount is a favour, and a favour nobody was told about buys
 * nothing.
 *
 * ## Only residents whose own bill moved
 *
 * The caller passes what actually changed per invoice — the old total, the new
 * one, and any credit that came out of it. A resident billed after the discount
 * was set never held a wrong bill and is not written to; their invoice arrived
 * correct.
 *
 * ## Nothing here may fail the correction
 *
 * The same rule the invoices, the listing projection and the rate-card notice
 * already hold. By the time this runs the money is right and the bills are
 * saved. A notification that threw would report "could not save the discount"
 * over a discount that was saved, and the owner would set it again.

/**
 * Applying a festival discount to a month that has **already been billed**.
 *
 * ## The case this exists for
 *
 * `cron/billing-cycle` issues a month's invoices on its first day, and a hostel
 * rarely decides Dashain in Aswin. A discount set on Kartik 5 therefore arrives
 * after forty residents already hold a bill for the full rent — and without this,
 * the warden would set 50%, see the row appear, and nothing whatever would happen
 * to the people it was meant for. That is worse than refusing the save.
 *
 * ## The bill is corrected, never rewritten
 *
 * The rent line is left exactly as issued and a **negative line** is added under
 * it:
 *
 * ```
 * Monthly rent — Kartik 2083            8,000
 * Dashain · 50% off                    -4,000
 *                             Total:    4,000
 * ```
 *
 * Editing the 8,000 down to 4,000 would make the invoice lie about what the rent
 * for Kartik was, and would silently contradict a bill the resident may already
 * have screenshotted or paid against. Two lines keep both truths: the rent was
 * 8,000, and 4,000 of it was forgiven. It is the same shape an applied credit
 * already takes, and `concessionPercent` on the line is what makes this one
 * findable so a change from 50% to 40% moves it instead of stacking a second.
 *
 * ## Money already paid becomes credit, because it cannot be un-taken
 *
 * `recomputeInvoiceBalance` re-derives the status from the settled events against
 * the new total, so a resident who had paid 5,000 of the 8,000 now shows PAID with
 * 1,000 over. That excess is written as credit against their next month rather
 * than left as an invisible negative — a refund is a decision for a human, and
 * credit is the part the system can do by itself.
 *
 * ## Nothing is reissued, because nothing was ever a file
 *
 * A resident's invoice has no stored document — the invoice screens read the
 * `Invoice` row, so the corrected total is what they see the moment this runs.
 * There is no PDF to regenerate and no old copy to chase.
 *
 * **Receipts are not touched, and must not be.** A receipt asserts that the
 * hostel *received* a specific amount on a specific day, and a discount does not
 * change what was received — the 5,000 that arrived on Kartik 3 arrived. Voiding
 * or reissuing it would make the hostel's own record of money it holds disagree
 * with its bank statement, which is the one thing `Receipt`'s immutability
 * exists to prevent. Where the payment now exceeds the bill, the difference
 * appears as credit; the receipt for it stays exactly as issued.
 *
 * What *is* sent is a notification, because the resident is holding a bill that
 * no longer matches ours — see `rent-concession-notify`.
 *
 * ## Withdrawing a discount only unwinds bills nobody has paid
 *
 * Deleting the row restores the total on invoices with **no settled payment**. An
 * invoice with money against it keeps the discount, because raising a bill a
 * resident has already part-paid against — after being told they owed less — is
 * the one correction the hostel cannot make politely, and because the credit it
 * generated may already have been spent on the following month.

/**
 * Cash, recorded properly (target §9.1, plan item 2.7).
 *
 * Cash is the one payment method with no external record — no gateway, no
 * statement line, no screenshot. Everything that makes it trustworthy has to be
 * built here, and the current system builds none of it: cash arrives through the
 * unrestricted `PATCH`, where an admin types a `paidAmount` and the record says
 * only that it changed.
 *
 * Three things make a cash entry answerable:
 *
 * 1. **A named collector.** `collectedBy` is who physically took the money,
 *    which is frequently not the person at the keyboard. Recording only the
 *    latter names the wrong human when the count is short.
 * 2. **A required `cashReceiptNumber`.** The hostel's paper book is the other
 *    half of the record, and it is what an audit reconciles against. It also
 *    forms the idempotency key, so re-submitting the same slip is a no-op by
 *    construction rather than a second credit.
 * 3. **Maker-checker above a threshold.** Above the hostel's
 *    `cashApprovalThreshold` the entry lands `PENDING` and a *different* person
 *    has to settle it. One person who can both record and confirm large cash is
 *    the entire control failure this replaces.

/**
 * Reminders and overdue chases (target §10.3, plan item 5.2).
 *
 * Three defects of the job this replaces, and the shape of each fix:
 *
 * 1. **`.limit(500)`, platform-wide, with no pagination.** Not a safety valve —
 *    a silent cap. The 501st open invoice on the platform was never chased and
 *    nothing said so. Fixed early, in 2.8, by the id cursor below.
 * 2. **Exact-day equality** (`daysUntilDue === N`). A single missed cron run
 *    skipped that resident *permanently*, because the day it would have fired
 *    never comes back. Replaced by a **stage recorded on the invoice**: the
 *    question is no longer "is today the day" but "has this invoice been chased
 *    at this stage yet", which a late run answers correctly and a double-run
 *    answers once.
 * 3. **No stop condition.** Chases continued forever. The ladder now terminates:
 *    three reminders (a week out, three days out, the due day) → first overdue
 *    on day three → second on day seven → four weekly chases → escalate to the
 *    owner → stop. After `STOPPED` the software never contacts the
 *    resident about this invoice again. That is the line between dunning and
 *    harassment, and it belongs in code rather than in a hostel's restraint.
 *
 * Every run writes a `ReconciliationRun` (§5.4), so a job that has been throwing
 * for a fortnight is visible rather than silent — which is exactly the failure
 * current §5.6 describes, where the run stats were returned to nobody.

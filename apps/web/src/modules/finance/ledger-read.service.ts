/**
 * The one place anything reads the ledger (ADR-3, D3).
 *
 * Eight services used to query `Payment` directly. Routing them through this
 * facade in item 2.3 is what made the cutover a change inside one file instead
 * of eight — and item 2.8 is that change: `Payment` is gone, and every function
 * below now answers from `Invoice` + `InvoiceBalance` + `PaymentEvent`.
 *
 * ## The scope type is still the point
 *
 * Consumers pass a {@link LedgerScope} — hostels, residents, periods — never a
 * Mongo filter. That is why none of them needed touching when the source
 * changed underneath them.
 *
 * ## Vocabulary
 *
 * {@link LedgerInvoice} still speaks `UNPAID` and `BANK_TRANSFER` where the
 * models say `OPEN` and `BANK`. The translation stays until Block 3 moves the
 * screens over one at a time; doing it here means the cutover did not have to
 * be a simultaneous rewrite of every consumer, which is the whole point of the
 * facade. `LEGACY_STATUS_BY_INVOICE_STATUS` is the list of what still has to
 * change, and it shrinks as Block 3 lands.
 *
 * `FINANCE_LEDGER_SOURCE` is gone with `Payment`: there is no longer a second
 * source to select, and a flag that can only take one value is a lie about what
 * is configurable.

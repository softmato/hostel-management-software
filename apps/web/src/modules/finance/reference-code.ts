/**
 * The reference code — `RUP-4821-K` (target §5, ADR-7).
 *
 * Principle P2: a payment is matched to its invoice because the payment
 * *carries* the invoice's code, not because software inspected it afterwards and
 * guessed. Everything downstream — statement matching, auto-settlement, the
 * whole Tier 0.5 reconciliation screen — rests on this being reliable when a
 * resident types it into a bank remarks field on a phone.
 *
 * Which is why the last character is a check character. A typo is detectable
 * **without a database lookup**, so parsing a statement of 84 free-text remarks
 * costs zero queries and a mistyped code is rejected rather than silently
 * matched to somebody else's invoice.
 *
 * Pure module: no I/O, no database, no clock. Generator, parser and validator
 * live together so they cannot drift apart.

/**
 * 31 symbols, not 32 — **a deliberate deviation from literal Crockford base32,
 * and the reason the check character works.**
 *
 * Crockford's set is the digits plus 22 letters (no I, L, O or U: the first
 * three are indistinguishable from 1 and 0 in many fonts, and U makes accidental
 * obscenities more likely in a code read aloud over the phone). That is 32
 * symbols, and 32 is a power of two — so a weighted checksum modulo 32 cannot
 * detect every single-character error, because a digit change of 16 at an
 * even-weighted position cancels exactly. Dropping `Z` gives **31, which is
 * prime**, and a prime modulus with consecutive weights catches *every* single
 * -character substitution and *every* adjacent transposition. Those are the two
 * mistakes people actually make copying a code, and item 1.5 requires both.
 *
 * Cost: 31⁴ = 923,521 codes per hostel instead of 1,048,576 — still the "~1M
 * values per hostel" of target §5.1.

 * position (0–25, comfortably under the modulus), so a typo in the hostel part
 * is caught exactly like a typo in the sequence.
 *
 * The practical consequence: `LIO` is a legal prefix. Confusable folding applies

/**
 * The interface every payment provider implements (target §6.5, plan §4.2).
 *
 * Written before any provider exists, and that is deliberate: Fonepay, eSewa and
 * Khalti all follow the same shape — merchant code plus shared secret, initiate
 * → redirect or QR → **server-side lookup** — and fixing the shape first is what
 * stops the second integration from being a copy of the first with the names
 * changed.
 *
 * Three rules are encoded in the types rather than left to each implementation:
 *
 * 1. **`verify` is not optional.** Target §6.5 step 7c: never trust the webhook
 *    body alone. A provider that cannot be independently asked "did this
 *    transaction really happen, for this amount" cannot be integrated, because
 *    the alternative is settling money on the word of an unauthenticated POST.
 * 2. **`parseWebhook` returns a reference, never a settlement.** It says what the
 *    payload *claims*; `verify` says what is true. Keeping them separate is what
 *    makes the rule above impossible to skip by accident.
 * 3. **The return URL is absent from this interface entirely.** It is guessable
 *    and carries no authority, and its only job is to show a "checking…" state.
 *    Giving it no seam here means no provider can grow one.

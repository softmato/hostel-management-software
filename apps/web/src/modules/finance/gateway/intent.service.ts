 *    verification; none of them is evidence.
 * 2. **A verified success still has to match.** The provider's amount must equal
 *    what we asked for. A disagreement is recorded and left unsettled, because
 *    the alternative is crediting an invoice for money that did not arrive.
 * 3. **Settling is idempotent through the ledger, not through a check here.**
 *    The event's `idempotencyKey` is `gateway:{provider}:{providerTxnId}`, and
 *    the unique index on it is what makes a replayed callback a no-op. A
 *    read-then-write guard in this file would have a race; the index does not.

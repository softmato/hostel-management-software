/**
 * eSewa ePay v2 (plan item 6.3).
 *
 * The first adapter, and deliberately so: eSewa's test merchant is published in
 * their own developer documentation, so this can be built and exercised without
 * waiting on anyone. It is also the *least* convenient of the three shapes — a
 * signed HTML form POST rather than a JSON API, with a signature over a declared
 * subset of fields in a declared order — so fixing the interface against it means
 * the JSON providers drop in rather than bending it.
 *
 * **eSewa has no server-to-server webhook in v2.** The confirmation comes back
 * on the resident's return URL as a base64 `data` parameter, signed the same way
 * our request was. {@link parseWebhook} verifies that payload — which lets us
 * identify *which attempt* the browser is reporting — and nothing more. The
 * status API is still what settles, exactly as it would be for a real webhook,
 * because a payload that arrives via the resident's own browser is the last thing
 * that should be trusted about money.

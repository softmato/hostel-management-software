/**
 * Khalti ePayment v2 (plan item 6.5).
 *
 * The second adapter, and the one that shows whether the interface was right:
 * Khalti is a JSON API where eSewa is a signed form POST, it identifies its
 * merchant by secret key alone where eSewa uses a product code, and it works in
 * **paisa** where every other number in this codebase is whole rupees. None of
 * that reached `provider.types.ts` — the differences are all inside this file,
 * which is what fixing the interface against the awkward provider first bought.
 *
 * **Amounts are in paisa.** NPR 12,000 is `1200000`. This is the single most
 * likely thing to get wrong here, and getting it wrong by a factor of a hundred
 * is not subtle: it either charges a resident a hundred times the rent or a
 * hundredth of it. Conversion happens at exactly two points, both below, and the
 * amount-mismatch guard in `intent.service.ts` catches the rest.

/**
 * Telling residents that the price of their room has changed.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The rate card is the only price in the product — the public listing and every
 * pricing field are projected from it, and the billing run reads it to decide
 * what each resident owes. So an owner editing it changes what somebody pays,
 * and until this module ran, it changed it **silently**. The resident found out
 * when an invoice arrived for a different number than the one they agreed to,
 * which is the worst possible way to learn it and the shape of a dispute the
 * hostel cannot win: nothing had told them, so nothing can show they were told.
 *
 * A rate card is always dated to a future month (`FEE_SCHEDULE_MONTH_LOCKED`
 * refuses anything else), which is what makes the notification worth sending
 * rather than merely polite — there is time to ask about it, or leave.
 *
 * ## Only the residents whose own rent moved
 *
 * Everyone gets *their* number, not the card. A resident in a four-sharing room
 * does not care what a single room now costs, and a card that changed only the
 * admission fee has changed nothing at all for anybody already living there —
 * telling them "your rent has changed" would be false.
 *
 * So each active resident is matched to the rate for their `roomType` in both
 * the outgoing and incoming card, and is written to only when those two differ.
 * A resident whose room type is absent from the new card is skipped rather than
 * guessed at: that is a gap in the card, and inventing a number for it would be
 * worse than the silence this module exists to end.
 *
 * ## Nothing here may fail the rate change
 *
 * Same rule the invoices and the listing projection already hold. By the time
 * this runs the card is written and is what the next billing run will read. A
 * notification that threw would report "could not save rates" over rates that
 * were saved, and the owner would type them again — landing on the
 * already-changed path with a card that now looks wrong.

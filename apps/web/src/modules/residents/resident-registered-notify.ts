/**
 * Everybody who should hear that a hostel just took a resident on.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists at all
 *
 * Registering somebody was, until this, the quietest write in the product. It
 * spends a bed, raises up to two invoices, promotes an account and starts a
 * rent obligation — and it told nobody. The resident learned about it if and
 * only if the intake happened to find an existing platform account to promote
 * (`residentLinkedEmail`), which is the minority case at a desk; the owner
 * learned about it by opening a screen; and nothing reached a phone at all.
 *
 * ## Push comes free, and that is the point of routing it through here
 *
 * `createInAppNotification` fans every row out to the recipient's socket and
 * their devices (`publishNewNotification`). So the durable bell row and the push
 * are one call, and there is no way for a caller to write one without the other
 * — which is exactly the drift that adding a `dispatchPush` at each call site
 * would guarantee.
 *
 * ## Nothing here may fail a registration
 *
 * Same rule the invoices already hold (`raiseFirstMonthInvoice`): by the time
 * this runs the resident exists, their bed is spent and their money is on the
 * ledger. A notification that throws would report "could not register" over a
 * registration that succeeded, and the warden would register them again — which
 * is how the duplicate-refusal path gets exercised by accident. Every failure in
 * here is logged and swallowed.
 */
/**
 * The marker the mobile app reads to know its own role just changed.
 *
 * Duplicated as a literal in `apps/mobile/src/lib/push-link.ts` rather than
 * imported: the two ship on different clocks, and a phone that has not updated
 * in a month is reading today's payloads. A shared constant would suggest they
 * move together, which is exactly what must not be assumed — so the string is
 * frozen, and both sides carry a comment pointing at the other.

 * to. That case is covered by the email below, which is the whole reason the
 * email is not conditional on the link.
 *
 * The category decides where a tap lands, so it follows what actually happened:
 * a resident who has been invoiced is sent to that invoice, and one who has not
 * is sent to their profile rather than to a payments screen with nothing on it.
 *
 * ## `type` is what turns the app into the resident app
 *
 * This is the one notification in the product that is *about the recipient's own
 * role changing*. Registering them promoted a `PUBLIC` account to `RESIDENT`
 * server-side, but every request the phone makes is authorised from the claims
 * baked into its access token — so until that token expires, the app they are
 * holding is still the public browsing app, and it will stay that way for the
 * rest of the token's life however many times they reopen it.
 *
 * The mobile client watches for this marker and re-reads the session when it
 * arrives, which rotates the token and lands them in the resident tabs
 * (`marksRoleChange` in `lib/push-link.ts`, `usePush`). It is sent whether or
 * not an invoice was raised, because the promotion happened either way.
 *
 * `data` is spread verbatim into the Expo payload by `sendPushToUsers`, so this
 * reaches the phone on the push as well as sitting on the durable bell row.

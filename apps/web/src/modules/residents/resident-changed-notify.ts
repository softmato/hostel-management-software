/**
 * Telling a resident about a change somebody else made to their record.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Registration was the loudest thing that could happen to a resident, and it
 * was already covered (`resident-registered-notify`). Everything *after* it was
 * silent: a warden could move somebody to a different room type, or suspend
 * their stay, and the only trace was an audit row nobody outside the office
 * reads. The resident found out by opening the app and noticing, or by turning
 * up at a bed that is no longer theirs.
 *
 * These are the two edits that change a person's living situation rather than
 * their paperwork, so these are the two that are announced.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* announced
 *
 * - **Contact edits.** A warden fixing a mistyped phone number is correcting
 *   the record to match reality, and "your email was changed" over a typo fix
 *   is an alarming sentence about nothing.
 * - **Deletion.** Removing somebody from the roll is nearly always a duplicate
 *   or a mis-entry being cleaned up. A person who was never really registered
 *   should not be told their stay ended, and one who genuinely left has already
 *   had `MOVED_OUT` announced below.
 * - **A move to `PENDING`.** That is an administrative reversal, not a state
 *   anybody experiences.
 *
 * ## Nothing here may fail the edit
 *
 * The same rule every notifier in this codebase holds. By the time this runs the
 * write is committed and the bed has already moved; a throw would report failure
 * over a change that succeeded, and the warden would do it again.

/**
 * A change of room **type**, which is the only kind of move this product
 * records.
 *
 * There is deliberately no bed or room *number* here, because `Resident` has no
 * such field — a hostel's inventory is counted by type, and which bed somebody
 * is in is not modelled. So "moved rooms" always means "moved between room
 * types", and that is worth announcing precisely because it is also the thing
 * the rate card prices: a resident moved from four-sharing to a single room is
 * being told the one fact that changes what they owe.

/**
 * Taking somebody off the field team — the write side of `team.service.ts`,
 * which only reads.
 *
 * ## Three actions, because "remove" means three different things
 *
 * A superadmin looking at a roster row wants one of three outcomes, and
 * collapsing them into a single button would either destroy work or fail to do
 * what was asked:
 *
 * - **Suspend.** They stop being able to sign in, today, and everything they
 *   registered stays attributed to them. This is the one to reach for while a
 *   reconciliation is unfinished or somebody is on leave. Reversible.
 * - **Remove from team.** The platform grant ends. The account survives and
 *   goes back to whatever role it held before the invitation took it over —
 *   `previousRole`, written by `acceptPlatformAdminInvitation` — or to PUBLIC
 *   if the team was the only thing it ever was. The registrations they filed
 *   keep pointing at a real account, so the money history stays readable.
 * - **Delete the account.** The row is gone from the database and the address
 *   is free again. Only offered when nothing references the account: no hostel
 *   filed, no payment collected, no role to fall back to. That is the case the
 *   word "delete" is honestly available for, and it is exactly the case a test
 *   agent or a mistyped invitation leaves behind.
 *
 * ## Why the third one is guarded rather than soft
 *
 * The obvious alternative — `isDeleted: true` everywhere — is what the rest of
 * this codebase does, and it is wrong here for one specific reason: the unique
 * index on `email` is not partial. A soft-deleted account keeps its address
 * forever, so "delete this agent and re-invite them properly" would fail on the
 * second half with a duplicate-key error and no way round it from the UI. A
 * real delete, allowed only when nothing points at the row, is the version that
 * does what the button says.
 *
 * ## Sessions are ended, with one honest gap
 *
 * Every write here bumps `tokenVersion` and drops the account's `Session` rows,
 * which kills the refresh: `refreshAccessToken` compares the version and
 * refuses, so nothing new can be minted.
 *
 * The access token already in the browser is *not* killed. It is a signed JWT
 * carrying the role, nothing reads `tokenVersion` on the way past, and it lives
 * for `ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL` (fifteen minutes by default). So a suspended agent
 * with a tab already open keeps working for up to that long and is then locked
 * out for good. Closing the gap properly means checking the version on every
 * authenticated request — a database read per call — and that is a decision
 * about the whole auth layer, not something to smuggle in behind a Suspend
 * button. It is written down here so nobody reads "suspended" on the roster and
 * believes it took effect this second.

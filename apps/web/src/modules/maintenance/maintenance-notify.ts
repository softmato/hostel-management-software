/**
 * Telling people about maintenance work.
 *
 * ## What was missing
 *
 * Maintenance was the one loop in the product where nobody was ever told
 * anything. A warden raised a request and the admin found out by opening the
 * queue; a job was assigned to a plumber and the plumber found out by opening
 * the app and looking; the plumber marked it done and the hostel found out the
 * same way. Every other module — complaints, payments, notices, food, SOS —
 * had a notifier; this one had an audit log and a socket topic, which tell a
 * screen that is already open and nobody who is not looking at it.
 *
 * The assignment case is the one that actually costs money. A job posted to a
 * contractor who is not looking at their phone is a job that waits until they
 * next open the app, and the leak the request is about carries on leaking.
 *
 * ## Everything here is best-effort
 *
 * The request row is committed before any of this runs. A failure to notify
 * must never turn a successfully-raised job into a failed one, so each function
 * swallows its own errors and the callers do not await a result they can act
 * on.

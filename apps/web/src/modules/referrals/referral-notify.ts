/**
 * Telling a referrer what happened to the person they referred.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A referral is the one thing in this product a resident does *for* the hostel,
 * and it was the least communicative flow in it. They hand their code to a
 * friend and then nothing ever reaches them again: the friend joins silently,
 * the reward is approved silently, and the reward is paid silently. The only
 * way to find out was to ask the office — which is precisely the effort the
 * referral programme exists to be worth more than.
 *
 * A reward nobody is told about does not motivate anybody, so this is closer to
 * making the feature work than to decorating it.
 *
 * ## Which states are worth saying out loud
 *
 * `PENDING` is bookkeeping — the row exists the moment a reward is contemplated,
 * and announcing it would promise something the hostel has not agreed to yet.
 * `APPROVED` and `PAID` are both real events for the referrer.
 *
 * `CANCELLED` is announced **only when we already told them good news**. A
 * reward cancelled out of `PENDING` was never promised, so a "your reward was
 * cancelled" for it is the first and last they would ever hear of a reward they
 * did not know existed. One cancelled after approval is a promise being
 * withdrawn, and staying quiet about that is worse than the awkwardness of
 * saying it.
 *
 * ## Nothing here may fail the referral update
 *
 * The rule every notifier in this codebase holds.

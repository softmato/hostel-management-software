/**
 * Telling somebody their stay is over, and what happened to their deposit.
 *
 * ## Why this is not covered by the status notifier
 *
 * `createMoveOutChecklist` writes `status: "MOVED_OUT"` with its own
 * `ResidentModel.updateOne`, rather than going through `updateResidentStatus`.
 * So the notification on that function — which does announce a move-out — never
 * fires on the path residents actually leave by. The dropdown was covered and
 * the real door was not.
 *
 * ## The deposit is the reason this matters
 *
 * A move-out checklist is also where the deposit is decided: refunded in full,
 * partially, or forfeited. That is the resident's own money, and the decision
 * was recorded, audited and then never communicated — the person who paid it
 * found out by asking, or did not find out at all.
 *
 * Which is why this is one notification rather than two. "Your stay has ended"
 * and "your deposit was forfeited" are the same conversation, and splitting them
 * into two rows would put the money news second.
 *
 * ## `PENDING` is a decision not yet taken
 *
 * A checklist saved with the deposit still undecided has nothing to report about
 * it, so the notice says the stay ended and explicitly that the deposit follows.
 * Promising a number that has not been agreed would be worse than saying it is
 * still open.
 *
 * Nothing here may fail the move-out: by the time it runs the bed is back in
 * the vacancy count and the resident is already MOVED_OUT.

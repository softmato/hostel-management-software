 * Raising one.

 * ## Why `title` and `description` are both optional now
 *
 * The resident's app asks one question — what is this about — then shows a live
 * camera and a record button. There is no title field on it, because a title is
 * a thing a form wants and a person standing in front of a blocked drain does
 * not have; `complaintTitle` derives one from whatever did arrive.
 *
 * `description` went with it because a spoken note *is* the description. The
 * pair is not optional together, though: `refine` below refuses a complaint
 * carrying neither, since a category and a photograph do not tell an admin what
 * they are looking at.
 *
 * The web form still sends both, and both still validate exactly as they did —
 * this only widens what is accepted.

/**
 * Where a **browser** push notification takes you when it is clicked.
 *
 * The counterpart of `push-routing.ts`, and separate from it for one reason
 * that is not going away: the phone app resolves a destination through Expo
 * Router's role-scoped groups — `/(resident)/payments` means "the payments
 * screen of whichever role stack this build is showing" — while the website has
 * no such thing. `/resident/payments` and `/hostel-admin/payments` are two
 * different URLs, one of which turns the other's audience away at the portal
 * guard.
 *
 * So this takes the recipient's `role` and the notification's category and
 * answers with a URL that person can actually open. Getting it wrong is not
 * cosmetic: a click that lands on a guard reads as "you are not allowed here"
 * for a message the platform chose to send them, which is worse than landing on
 * a list.
 *
 * ## Why `actionUrl` still wins
 *
 * Most notifications already carry one, it is already a website path (the bell
 * links straight to it), and it is already the most specific destination anyone
 * has for that row. A category default can only ever be a list; `actionUrl` is
 * the thing itself.

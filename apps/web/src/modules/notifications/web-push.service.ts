/**
 * Web Push delivery — the browser half of `push.service.ts`.
 *
 * Until this file existed the platform had one push transport, Expo, and it
 * reached one surface: a phone with the app installed. Everyone who runs the
 * hostel from a laptop — which is most wardens, every platform moderator, and
 * every admin during office hours — got the bell badge and nothing else, so a
 * payment claim raised at 11am waited for somebody to look at the tab.
 *
 * This is the same contract as the Expo sender, deliberately:
 *
 *   - **Never throws into a caller.** The `Notification` row is committed long
 *     before delivery is attempted, so an unreachable push service costs a
 *     buzz, not the message.
 *   - **Prunes what it is told is dead.** A push service answering `404` or
 *     `410 Gone` is saying the subscription no longer exists — the browser was
 *     uninstalled, the profile was wiped, permission was revoked. Those rows are
 *     marked REVOKED rather than deleted, matching `DeviceNotRegistered`
 *     handling on the Expo side.
 *
 * The one structural difference is encryption. Expo takes a token and does the
 * rest; Web Push seals the payload for one subscription using keys the browser
 * generated, which is why `DeviceToken.keys` exists and why a row missing
 * either half is skipped instead of attempted.

/**
 * How many endpoints are in flight at once.
 *
 * Web Push has no batch endpoint — each subscription is a separate encrypted
 * HTTPS request to whichever service that browser uses. A platform-wide
 * announcement can therefore mean thousands of them, and `Promise.allSettled`
 * over the whole array would open thousands of sockets in one tick: a
 * self-inflicted outage on the exact notification that matters most, and the
 * kind that only appears once the platform is big enough for it to hurt.
 *
 * Expo's own sender has this ceiling for free — 100 messages per request — so
 * this is the equivalent limit on the side that has to make its own.

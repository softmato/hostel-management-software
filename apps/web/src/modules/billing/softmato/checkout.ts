/**
 * Sending the owner off to pay, and where they land coming back.
 *
 * ## A session is a cheque, not a link
 *
 * It lives 30 minutes and it is bearer-ish: forwarded, reused, or paid after
 * the price changed. So one is minted at the moment the owner presses Pay —
 * every time, including retries — and never stored, never emailed, never
 * pre-generated for a renewal that is a week away. The thing we persist is the
 * invoice; the thing we hand out is a fresh session against it.
 *
 * ## There is no amount parameter, deliberately
 *
 * The amount is read from the invoice on their side. A client-supplied one
 * would let anybody who can reach our endpoint choose their own price.
 *
 * ## The return URL carries no payment status
 *
 * Not because we forgot: **there is no status in it and never will be.** The
 * owner reaches that page by clicking, and they can reach it without paying.
 * What actually happened is learned from the webhook, or from a server-side
 * `getTransaction` — see `./transaction.ts`. Anything in the query string is a
 * claim made by whoever's browser made the request.
 *
 * The one thing we do put there is our own invoice number, so the page knows
 * which purchase the reader just came back from. That is a *navigation* hint
 * and it is treated as one: the page re-checks ownership against the session
 * before it shows anything, and shows the status it read from Softmato, not
 * from the URL.

 * The plan copy that reaches a customer on Softmato's checkout page and

 *
 * Every string here comes from a catalogue a platform owner edits in a form,
 * and Softmato **rejects** a presentation block that quotes a price or breaks a
 * length rule. A rejected block does not degrade the invoice — it fails the
 * whole `createInvoice` call, and the owner cannot pay us.
 *
 * So what is pinned below is not formatting. It is that a marketing edit can
 * never take the payment flow down.

/**
 * The manual lane: an owner pays us by QR and sends back the proof.
 *
 * ## Why a lane and not a replacement
 *
 * `subscription-payment.service` opens a Softmato checkout, and that is the
 * rail this platform is built on. This file is what runs when the rail is not
 * carrying owner-initiated payments — which is today — and it does **not**
 * retire when the rail lands. There will always be an owner whose banking app
 * worked and whose checkout did not, and a business that can only be paid one
 * way is a business that turns money away. So the two coexist: the pay screen
 * offers the rail first once there is one, and this underneath it.
 *
 * ## Nothing here records money
 *
 * A claim is a **statement by the payer**, and the whole design follows from
 * refusing to treat one as a settlement:
 *
 * - the row is written `IN_REVIEW`, and `outstandingFor` sums only `SETTLED`,
 *   so a claim moves no balance, publishes no hostel and clears no due;
 * - the only thing that turns it into money received is
 *   `reviewPlanPaymentClaim`, run by a platform admin who has looked at the
 *   proof, and that hands off to the same `settlePayment` a webhook uses — one
 *   receipt path, one activation path, one publish path;
 * - a refusal writes `FAILED` and leaves the invoice exactly as it was.
 *
 * This is the same shape as a resident's `PaymentEvent` claim one level down,
 * for the same reason, and the guards on the proof asset are lifted from it
 * deliberately rather than reinvented — every one of them was a security fix.
 *
 * ## One claim in flight at a time
 *
 * An owner who taps submit twice, or who pays and claims again the next day
 * because nobody has written back yet, must not produce two rows a reviewer has
 * to reconcile against one payment. The second attempt is refused with the fact
 * that the first is still being looked at, which is also the answer to the
 * question they were really asking.

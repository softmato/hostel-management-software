/**
 * Browser notifications for a signed-in account that is not in a portal.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * The only place the product ever offered to turn browser push on was the bell
 * in `portal-shell` — which renders for staff, residents and guardians, and for
 * nobody else. A PUBLIC account browsing hostels therefore had no subscription
 * on file, and `sendPushToUsers` had no endpoint to deliver to.
 *
 * That is exactly the account that most needs one. The first push a person ever
 * receives from this product is "you are registered": a hostel takes them on,
 * `promoteAccountToResident` raises their account to RESIDENT, invoices are
 * raised with reference codes and `notifyResidentRegistered` fans the news out
 * to their devices. On a phone the app has already registered a token at the
 * root layout, so it lands. On a laptop it landed nowhere, because the only
 * screen that could have asked for permission was the resident portal they did
 * not have yet.
 *
 * ## Asked, never assumed
 *
 * `Notification.requestPermission()` is ignored by Chrome and refused outright
 * by Safari unless it comes from a user gesture, and a permission prompt thrown
 * at somebody reading a hostel listing is how a site gets permanently denied. So
 * this is a button in the account menu and nothing more.
 *
 * The one thing it does unprompted is {@link resyncBrowserPush} when permission
 * is *already* granted — that costs one request and repairs the cases where the
 * browser still believes it is subscribed and the server no longer has the row:
 * a pruned endpoint, a rotated VAPID key, or another account having signed in on
 * this machine. Without it, somebody who enabled push as a resident last month
 * and signed in again today is silently unreachable.

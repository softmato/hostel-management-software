/**
 * "Who is signed in?", answered with a token that is still true.
 *
 * Two different staleness problems, healed in the one place every shell already
 * asks the question.
 *
 * 1. **The token expired.** A 401 is refreshed once and the question re-asked.
 * 2. **The account changed under the token.** `/auth/me` reads the database and
 *    reports `sessionStale` when the access token's role or hostels no longer
 *    match it. That is the registration case: a hostel promotes somebody's
 *    PUBLIC account to RESIDENT, and their tab keeps a PUBLIC token — the shell
 *    draws the public site, and every resident route would refuse them. Nothing
 *    401s, so case 1 never fires; `browser-api`'s 403 heal never fires either,
 *    because the public site calls no resident route to be refused by.
 *
 * Refreshing re-reads the role from the database (`refreshAccessToken`), so one
 * rotation puts the tab on the right side of every guard. The second answer is
 * returned rather than the first: a caller that rendered the stale one would
 * paint the public header over an account that is now a resident.

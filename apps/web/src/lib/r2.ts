/**
 * Storage lives in **two** buckets, split by whether the object is world-readable.
 *
 * The single-bucket arrangement this replaces had a hole that the 15-minute
 * presigned TTL hid rather than closed. A presigned URL carries the object key
 * in its path, so anyone who was ever shown one could strip the `X-Amz-*` query
 * string and re-request the same key unsigned — and because the one bucket had
 * public access enabled so that gallery photos could be served, that unsigned
 * request succeeded. Forever. Payment proofs and citizenship scans sat in that
 * bucket alongside the photos.
 *
 * Splitting them means the private bucket has no public base URL at all, so
 * there is no unsigned form of the request to fall back to. The TTL becomes the
 * real limit rather than a decorative one.
 *
 * Objects are additionally namespaced under `R2_KEY_PREFIX`, because these
 * buckets are shared with the rest of the company's projects.

 * A presigned PUT for one object.

 *
 * This used to take a `maxSizeBytes` and put it on the command, which reads like
 * a size cap and is not one. SigV4 signs every header on the request that is not
 * in its unsignable list, and `content-length` is not in that list — so the
 * number went into `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` as an **exact** value the client then
 * had to reproduce byte for byte. One byte out and R2 answers
 * `SignatureDoesNotMatch`, on a request that never touches our infrastructure:
 * nothing in our logs, and a client with no way to tell the failure apart from a
 * dropped connection.
 *
 * That is what it did on the mobile ID-card photo. The app declared the size
 * `expo-image-picker` reported for the picked asset and then uploaded the
 * cropped, re-encoded file at that uri, which is a different length. The presign
 * returned 200, the PUT died at R2, and the phone said "check your connection".
 *
 * Removing it costs nothing, because the size was never enforced here:
 * `validateFileAssetMetadata` rejects an over-large declaration at presign time,
 * and `verifyUploadedObject` re-reads the stored object at `/complete` and
 * refuses it if the real length differs from the declared one. That check is the
 * one that protects storage — it looks at the bytes that actually arrived — and
 * it fails loudly, in our logs, with a message a client can act on.
 *
 * `ContentType` stays signed on purpose: it is the type the object is stored and
 * served with, so binding it is worth the matching requirement. Both sides read
 * it from one function (`lib/mime.ts` on the phone) for exactly that reason.

/**
 * The universal downloader.
 *
 * Every file the site *retrieves* goes through {@link downloadFile}: it
 * registers a row in the global download store (which the always-mounted
 * toaster renders as a live progress bar), streams the bytes with byte-level
 * progress, and hands the result to the browser's download manager. Call sites
 * never touch fetch, streams or object URLs.
 *
 * The mirror of `lib/uploads/uploader.ts`, and the reason it exists: a report
 * export used to be a plain `<a href>`. That works, and it tells the user
 * nothing — a click on "Collection CSV" produced no feedback at all until the
 * browser's own download chip appeared, and on a slow query that is several
 * seconds of a page that looks broken. Worse, an `<a>` navigates on failure, so
 * an expired session answered "download my report" with a raw JSON error body
 * rendered as a page.
 *
 * ## Why this streams rather than awaiting `response.blob()`
 *
 * `blob()` resolves once, at the end. There is no progress in it, so the bar
 * would sit at 0 and then jump to done — which is a spinner with extra steps.
 * Reading `response.body` chunk by chunk is the only way the browser exposes
 * transfer progress on a fetch, and it is what makes this worth having over the
 * anchor it replaces.
 *
 * ## Credentials
 *
 * These routes are same-origin and cookie-authorised, so the default
 * `same-origin` credentials mode already sends the session. Nothing here reads
 * or forwards a token.

 * TanStack cache is parked in `sessionStorage` and survives the reload that
 * follows, so a missed call here leaves the previous account's rows sitting in
 * the tab for the next person to sign in.
 *
 * Clearing runs in `finally` — a logout request that fails still means the user
 * asked to leave, and the caller redirects either way.

/**
 * What the bytes actually are (target §13.3, gap fix 1).
 *
 * `verifyUploadedObject` used to compare storage's `ContentType` against the
 * type declared at presign — but on a presigned PUT *both* of those come from
 * the client. Storage records whatever `Content-Type` header the uploader sent,
 * so the check compared the client's claim against the same client's claim and
 * agreed every time. Anything at all could be stored as `image/png`.
 *
 * This reads the leading bytes instead. A file's format is in its magic number,
 * which the uploader does not get to choose, so a declaration that disagrees
 * with the bytes is refused rather than recorded.
 *
 * **Families, not exact types.** The question is never "is this precisely
 * `image/jpeg`" — it is "is this declaration a lie". A `.mov` and an `.mp4` are
 * both ISO base media files and browsers disagree about which label to attach,
 * so refusing one because the other was declared would bounce good uploads to no
 * benefit. Types that share a container share a family and satisfy each other.
 *
 * Pure module: no I/O, no clock, no database.

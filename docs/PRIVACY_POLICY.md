- Request via Settings → Privacy → "Download My Data"

### 7.2 Right to Rectification
- Update your profile information anytime
- Request corrections via hostel administrator

### 7.3 Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten")

- Control guardian access permissions

### 7.6 Right to Restrict Processing

---

## 8. Account Deletion & Data Retention

### 8.1 Request Account Deletion
1. Go to **/account/privacy** → "Delete my account"
2. Fill out deletion request form (reason required)
3. Confirm deletion request

**What the button does depends on your account** — the page tells you before you
press it (ARCHITECTURE.md §13.0 is the full table):

- **Most accounts** get the 60-day flow in §8.2.
- **Guardians** are removing their guardian *access*, not their account. It
  becomes an ordinary account, which can then be deleted outright.
- **Current residents cannot delete** while they are living in a hostel — the
  hostel needs that record while you are in a bed. You can delete after moving
  out. Staff accounts are closed by your hostel administrator.
- **Hostel owners** cannot delete on the spot, because their residents' payments
  and records depend on the account. The request goes to the platform owner and
  the account keeps working normally until it is reviewed.

### 8.2 60-Day Grace Period
- Your account is immediately **closed** (cannot log in)
- Data is retained for 60 days
- You can **cancel deletion** anytime during this period, using the link in the
  confirmation email — since your account is closed, that link is how you get
  back in
- After 60 days: permanent deletion executed

### 8.3 What Gets Deleted (After 60 Days)
✅ **Immediately Deleted**:
- Your User account
- Resident profile
- All location data (AttendanceLog)
- All device tokens
- All notification receipts
- All consent logs
- Community posts/comments (set to anonymous, author removed)

⚠️ **Retained for Legal/Audit** (anonymized):
- Payment records (amounts, dates — the link to you is removed with your
  resident profile; see the note in ARCHITECTURE.md §13.2 on why the row itself
  is left alone rather than nulled)
- Receipt records (financial audit trail)
- Audit logs (system security, compliance)
- Aggregated analytics (no personal identifiers)

### 8.4 Location Data Deletion (Without Account Deletion)
- Request via Settings → Privacy → "Delete Location History"
- Hostel admin reviews request
- Approved: All AttendanceLog entries deleted
- Aggregated statistics retained (no personal identifiers)

## 9. Children's Privacy

- Platform is intended for users aged 16+
- If under 18, guardian consent may be required (varies by country/hostel policy)
- We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13

---

## 10. International Data Transfers

- Data stored on servers in [specify region, e.g., "Singapore" or "US"]
- If you're in EU/EEA: data transfers comply with GDPR standards
- Adequate safeguards in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses)

---

## 11. Changes to Privacy Policy

### 11.1 Updates
- We may update this policy from time to time
- Changes posted with updated "Last Updated" date
- Significant changes: email notification sent

### 11.2 Your Consent to Changes
- Continued use after changes = acceptance
- For material changes (e.g., new data collection): explicit consent required

---

## 12. Contact & Data Protection Officer

### 12.1 Questions or Concerns
- Email: privacy@[platform-domain].com
- Or contact your hostel administrator

### 12.2 Complaints
- If you believe we've violated your privacy rights:
  - Contact us first: privacy@[platform-domain].com

## Appendix: Location Tracking Technical Details (For Transparency)

### How It Works:
1. Your mobile app requests location permission during activation
2. Background service activates at configured times (3x daily)
3. App gets your current location (latitude/longitude)
4. App sends to server: `{ lat: 27.xxxx, lng: 85.xxxx, timestamp }`
5. **Server immediately calculates**: distance from hostel coordinates
6. **Server determines zone**: INSIDE (≤50m), NEARBY (51-200m), OUTSIDE (>200m)
7. **Server stores**: zone status + distance (e.g., "INSIDE, 32m")
8. **Server DISCARDS**: exact latitude/longitude coordinates
9. **Result**: AttendanceLog entry with zone, distance, timestamp

### Why This Matters:
- Even if our database is compromised, attackers get "INSIDE, 32m" not "27.7172°N, 85.3240°E"
- Privacy by design: we can't share what we don't have

### Battery Impact:
- Location checked only 3 times per day (not continuous tracking)
- Uses "balanced" accuracy (not high-precision GPS)
- Minimal battery drain (< 1% per day)

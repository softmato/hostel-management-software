# Mobile task list — created 2026-08-18 07:25

Work order for `apps/mobile`, opened after the audit of 2026-08-18. This file is the
**handoff document**: if a session ends mid-way, the next one starts by reading this
file top to bottom and picks up at the first unticked box.

## How to use this file

- **One item at a time.** Write the code, verify it (typecheck + lint + tests, and the
  browser/API where it applies), then flip `☐` to `☑` **in this file** before starting
  the next item. Do not batch.
- A `☑` means *seen working*, not *file created*. Where "working" needs a phone, the box
  says so and stays `☐` until the device pass — those are marked **[device]**.
- Items marked **[yours]** need an account, a key, or an asset only the owner can supply.
  Leave them and move on.
- Anything discovered mid-task that is out of scope gets appended to §7, not fixed inline.

## Verification commands

```bash
npm run mobile:typecheck && npm run mobile:lint && npm run mobile:test
```

```bash
npm run test --workspace web && npm run lint --workspace web
```

## Standing facts for the next session

- **Deployed web API:** `https://hostel-management-software-web.vercel.app` — live,
  `/api/v1/public/hostels` answers 200. This is what release builds must point at.
- **EAS:** logged in as `siddthecoder`, project `b2b0ab97-162c-425c-8f06-6e7db901e1e6`.
  Checked 2026-08-18: **no environment variables exist** in development, preview or
  production. FCM V1 key: the owner says it is uploaded — verify with
  `eas credentials` (interactive; the owner has to run it, it hangs a non-interactive shell).
- **Google:** the OAuth client IDs and `google-services.json` are *deliberately* separate
  concerns — the client IDs are for sign-in, `google-services.json` is only the FCM
  channel for push. They do not need to be the same Google Cloud project. The audit's
  "two projects" finding is **withdrawn**; what remains is only that neither file reaches
  an EAS build (§1.4).
- Baseline before this work: typecheck clean, lint clean, **459 tests / 36 files** green.
- `apps/mobile` has ~98 untracked files (M4–M7). Do not `git clean` this tree.

---

## 1. Blockers — the app is broken in production until these are done

- ☑ **1.1 Persist the rotated refresh token.** *(2026-08-18)*
      New pure seam `src/lib/refresh-tokens.ts` + 5 tests; `api.ts` now writes both tokens
      via `writeTokens`, and treats a response with no `refreshToken` as "unchanged"
      rather than "clear it", so a server on the cookie branch cannot force a logout.
- ☑ **1.2 Make `useResource` refetch when its loader changes.** *(2026-08-18)*
      Fetch effect now keys on `[load, run]`; four fetch modes (`initial` / `requery` /
      `refresh` / `silent`) decide what a failure does. A changed loader shows the
      refresh spinner through a **derived** `requerying` value, so no `setState` lands in
      an effect body. `run` keeps a stable identity by reading `data` through a ref —
      depending on `data` directly would have made it re-fetch on its own result.
      Fixes the dead controls on browse-hostels, the notification bell and Community.
      **Requirement this creates:** every `useResource` loader must stay memoised — an
      unmemoised inline arrow now fetches in a loop. All 43 call sites were checked.
- ☑ **1.3 Give every build an API base URL.** *(2026-08-18)*
      `eas.json` now carries an `env` block plus an explicit `environment` on all three
      profiles. `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set on **preview and production only** — setting
      it on `development` would have silently disabled the Metro-host detection in
      `resolveApiBaseUrl`, because a configured non-private host wins over the LAN branch,
      and every dev build would have talked to production. The Google client IDs are on
      all three (`.env` is gitignored and never reaches EAS). The release fallback also
      moved off `localhost` to the deployed origin, so a misconfigured build degrades to
      working rather than to dead.
- ☑ **1.4 Make an EAS build work from a clean checkout.** *(2026-08-18)*
      **Not committed — this GitHub repo is public** (`softmato/hostel-management-software`,
      confirmed 200 unauthenticated). A committed `AIza…` key gets scraped and the Firebase
      project has to be rotated, so `google-services.json` is now **gitignored** (it was
      merely untracked, i.e. one `git add .` from being public forever) and reaches builds
      as an EAS **file** variable instead: `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`, uploaded secret to
      development + preview + production, read by the new `app.config.js` overlay on
      `app.json`. Verified: `expo config` resolves the package and the file path, and
      `expo export --platform android` bundles (6 MB).
      **Keep a copy of `google-services.json` outside the repo** — a fresh clone has no
      copy and the EAS variable is write-only. It is re-downloadable from the Firebase
      console for `softmato-e65a6` if lost.

## 2. M6 — finish public discovery

- ☑ **2.1 Map/list toggle on browse.** *(2026-08-18)*
      `HostelMap` gained a `fill` prop (take the parent's space instead of a fixed 260dp);
      `hostel-browser.tsx` gained a two-segment `ViewSwitch` beside "Sort: nearest" and a
      map branch that draws the same `ordered` rows. **`<Screen scroll>` is switched off in
      map view** — a full-bleed map inside a vertical ScrollView puts two pan gestures on
      the same pixels and the map loses about half of them. Pull-to-refresh goes with the
      scroll; the filters still refetch, which is the case that matters. List stays the
      default: the map is blank with no network, cannot show an un-geocoded hostel, and
      price and vacancy do not fit on a pin.
      Verified: typecheck, lint, 464 tests, `expo export` bundles (6 MB). Pin taps and
      tile loading are **[device]** — a WebView cannot be exercised from here.
- ☑ **2.2 Web `?ref=` referral handling.** *(2026-08-18)*
      New `apps/web/src/lib/referral-code.ts` (+8 tests) reads and validates the code
      against the server's own 4–32 range — *not* the activation range, which starts at 6
      and would have silently dropped short codes. `public-inquiry-page.tsx` now renders a
      separate `ReferredInquiryForm` when `?ref=` is present: name / phone / optional
      email / optional message only, because `referredInquiryCreateSchema` accepts nothing
      else, posting to `/public/inquiries/with-referral`. The hostel is deliberately not
      named — no public endpoint maps a code to a hostel, and the old page would have shown
      `green-view-hostel` (its hardcoded default) to someone whose friend lives elsewhere.
      The hostel fetch is guarded off for referral visits; an early return does not stop an
      effect.
      **Verified in a browser** against `npm --prefix apps/web run dev`:
      `/inquiry?ref=ABC123` renders the referral form with **no** `public/hostels/…`
      request in the network log, and `/inquiry?hostel=question-call-hostel-narephat`
      still renders the full hostel column, room types and every original field.
      Web suite 1770 passing, src typecheck and lint clean.
- ☑ **2.3 Verified app links.** *(2026-08-18)*
      Three parts, and all three are needed or none of it works:
      1. `apps/web/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` — static, so it answers fast and
         cacheably at install time with no redirect (Android follows neither). Fingerprint
         read from the local release keystore with `keytool`:
         `AA:45:1C:…:E8:E1`. Verified locally: `200`, `application/json`.
         `public/.well-known/README.md` records how to reread it and the **two ways this
         goes silently wrong** — an EAS-managed keystore signing instead of the local one,
         and Play App Signing re-signing with Google's key (add, never replace).
      2. `app.json` `intentFilters`, `autoVerify: true`, scoped to **three paths only** —
         `/ref/*`, `/inquiry`, `/guardian-invite`. Claiming the whole host would send
         `/hostels`, `/community` and every marketing page into an app that has no such
         routes.
      3. New `apps/mobile/src/app/inquiry.tsx`. expo-router resolves an incoming URL **by
         path**, so `https://…/inquiry?ref=X` looks for `app/inquiry.tsx` — which did not
         exist, meaning a verified link would have opened the app straight onto
         `+not-found`. It redirects to the existing `ref/[code]` screen during render
         (`<Redirect>`, not an effect, so no frame is painted first), and sends a link
         that lost its query string to the public app rather than to an error.
      Remaining and **[yours]**: Android only verifies against the **live** domain, so this
      is provable once the web deploy carries the file. If Play App Signing is turned on,
      add that fingerprint too.
- ☑ **2.4 Public announcements section — cut.** *(2026-08-18, decision recorded in
      `MOBILE_APP_PHASES.md` §M6)*
      No public announcement feed exists anywhere: `Notice` is hostel-scoped and
      resident-only, and `notification-campaign.service.ts` broadcasts to signed-in
      accounts. Building one is a new server module — model, authoring surface,
      moderation, routes — and **the mockup only ever draws this section empty**. Same
      call already taken on the hero copy, trust tiles and stats band. **Say so if you
      want it built anyway** — it is a product decision, not a technical block, and it
      would be a day of server work before any mobile screen changes.
- ☐ **2.5 [device]** Fresh install → browse hostels with no account.
- ☐ **2.6 [device]** Register → scan QR → dashboard, no relaunch, no login flash.
- ☐ **2.7 [device]** Manual code entry reaches the same state.

## 3. M1–M5 — the open items that are code, not a device pass

- ☑ **3.1 Revoke the device token on logout (M4).** *(2026-08-18)*
      Server: `deviceTokenRevokeSchema`, `revokeDeviceToken()` and a `DELETE` handler on
      the existing `/mobile/device-token` route. The filter carries **`userId` as well as
      the token** — push tokens are client-posted and not secret, so without the scope the
      route would let anyone holding an observed token silence that person's device,
      SOS alerts included. Status goes to `REVOKED`, never deleted (`account-purge` owns
      removal, and deleting races a re-registration already in flight). A token matching
      nothing is a success: the caller is signing out and the desired state already holds.
      Mobile: `revokePushToken()` in `push-notifications.ts`, called from `endSession`
      **before `clearTokens()`** because the call is authenticated, and unconditionally —
      `revoke: false` means the refresh token is dead, not that the device should keep
      receiving the old account's alerts. Never throws.
      Verified: 4 new server tests, `DELETE` answers 401 unauthenticated against the local
      dev server, mobile 464 tests / lint / typecheck green, web src clean.
- ☑ **3.2 Notification preferences + quiet hours (M4).** *(2026-08-18)*
      Server: `packages/db/.../NotificationPreference.ts`, a pure
      `notification-quiet-hours.ts` (13 tests), `notification-preference.service.ts`
      (6 tests) and `GET`/`PATCH /account/notification-preferences`. `sendPushToUsers`
      filters recipients **before** the token lookup.
      Four decisions worth not re-litigating:
      • **Urgent bypasses everything** — master switch, muted category and quiet hours
        alike. The urgent channel is SOS; a settings screen able to silence a safety
        alert is a setting whose worst case is a person not being found.
      • **No row means yes.** The absence of an opinion is not an opinion — reading
        `null` as "wants nothing" would have muted every existing user on deploy.
      • **A failed lookup keeps the whole audience.** Over-delivering during a database
        blip is recoverable; silence is the failure nobody reports.
      • **Quiet hours are minutes past local midnight and wrap midnight** (22:00→07:00 is
        `start > end`, the ordinary case). `localMinutesNow` uses `Intl`, not offset
        arithmetic, because Nepal is **+05:45** and whole-hour maths is 45 minutes wrong.
      Mobile: `notification-preferences.ts` (pure, 9 tests) split from
      `notification-preferences-api.ts` — anything importing `lib/api` drags in
      `react-native`, which the node-only runner cannot parse. New `ui/toggle.tsx`
      wrapping the platform `Switch`. Settings' Notifications section is now real
      controls, saved per-field on change with optimistic UI and rollback, plus a card
      stating that urgent alerts always come through. **`MUTABLE_CATEGORIES` has no SOS
      row** — the server overrides it, so the switch would be a lie.
      Verified: mobile 473 tests / lint / typecheck; web 1793 tests / src typecheck /
      lint; both routes answer 401 unauthenticated against the local dev server.
- ☑ **3.3 Bikram Sambat dates (M1) — mobile.** *(2026-08-18)*
      `formatDateBs` / `formatDateBoth` in `lib/format.ts` → `2 Bhadra 2083 · 18 Aug 2026`,
      applied to invoice due dates (both invoice screens), which is where the decision's
      own reasoning lands: a one-calendar due date makes somebody convert in their head
      at the moment a mistake costs money.
      **Dependency, not a hand-copied table.** BS month lengths vary per year and are
      tabulated data; transcribing them from memory would be inventing something
      authoritative that is wrong in one cell nobody notices for a year.
      `nepali-date-converter@3.4.0` (MIT) was checked against five New Year anchors
      before adoption — 2013-04-14, 2023-04-14, 2024-04-13, 2025-04-14, 2026-04-14 all
      land on Baisakh 1 — and 4 tests hold that. Converts on the **Nepal** day so a phone
      on another timezone still reads the hostel's date; a year outside the table falls
      back to Gregorian rather than to a wrong Nepali date. Bundle 6.0 → 6.1 MB.
      Web half is §7.3.
- ☑ **3.4 Save the whole ID card to the camera roll (M5).** *(2026-08-18)*
      `react-native-view-shot@5.1.0` + a new `shareLocalImage()` in `lib/documents.ts`
      (kept separate from `shareDataUrlImage` — one starts from base64 the server sent,
      the other from a path `captureRef` wrote; a function taking "either" is the shape
      that gets passed the wrong one). "Save this card" snapshots what is on screen.
      **Captured, not server-rendered**: the card *is* the layout — photo, QR, hostel
      accent and the fields that card type carries all live in `IdCardFace` — so a
      server-side PNG would be a second implementation of the design, wrong the first
      time the card changed.
      `collapsable={false}` on the wrapper is load-bearing: React Native flattens a view
      that only wraps another, and a flattened view has no native handle for `captureRef`.
      It saves **the face you are looking at** (the card flips on tap), which is why the
      row's subtitle names it.
      Verified: typecheck, lint, 477 tests, bundles at 6.1 MB. Needs a dev build to
      actually run — view-shot is native, so it is inert in Expo Go and the failure is
      caught and explained rather than thrown. **[device]** to confirm the saved image.
- ☐ **3.5 Real logo (M1) — [yours].** Placeholders are in `assets/images/`.

## 4. UI defects from the audit

- ☑ **4.1 Keyboard covers the submit button on 11 screens.** *(2026-08-18)*
      The `footer` moved **inside** the `KeyboardAvoidingView`, and
      `softwareKeyboardLayoutMode` went from `"pan"` to `"resize"`. Both halves are
      needed: `pan` shoved the whole Android window up and pushed the footer off the
      bottom edge, while on iOS `behavior="padding"` padded the scroll body and left the
      footer sitting under the keyboard. Android keeps `behavior: undefined` on purpose —
      the resized window already carries the footer, and padding on top of that would
      compensate twice. Fixed once in `Screen`; no screen changed. **[device]** to
      confirm on both keyboard modes.
- ☑ **4.2 Compare rows scroll independently.** *(2026-08-18)*
      Eleven `ScrollView`s collapsed into **one**, wrapping the header cells, every field
      row and the inquiry buttons together — so the columns share a scroll position by
      construction rather than by keeping several in step. Labels stack above their values
      inside it and travel with them; a pinned label column would need a synchronised
      second scroller, which is a lot of machinery for six short words. The header comment
      that claimed this already worked has been corrected.
- ☑ **4.3 Tab bar hides on the first touch after returning to a scrolled tab.**
      *(2026-08-18)* `reset()` now parks `lastOffset` at `-1` meaning "no baseline", and
      the first scroll event after it establishes the real offset and returns instead of
      being measured. Previously a tab sitting at 800dp produced `delta = 800 - 0` on the
      next event — far past `HIDE_AFTER`, so the bar slid away on the first touch in
      either direction.
- ☑ **4.4 Failed pull-to-refresh blanks the screen.** *(2026-08-18, with 1.2)*
      A failed `refresh` with data on screen now toasts and keeps the list. Setting
      `error` was not survivable: every screen branches `error ? <ErrorState/> : …`
      *before* it looks at `data`, so keeping the data alone would still have blanked.
- ☑ **4.5 Push permission prompt fires during boot.** *(2026-08-18)*
      `requestPushPermission({ ask })` now **defaults to not asking** — it reads the
      permission and stops. Boot and the foreground re-check register silently when
      permission is already granted and do nothing when it is not, so the system dialogue
      never appears over a dashboard nobody has read. The ask moved to Settings, behind a
      card that explains what the alerts are for, with separate copy and a
      settings-deep-link for the `blocked` case (on Android 13+ a second refusal is
      permanent, so a "Turn on notifications" button there would do nothing). The rule was
      already written above the function; the default now enforces it instead of a comment.
- ☑ **4.6 Bottom sheets with text inputs have no keyboard mode.** *(2026-08-18)*
      `android_keyboardInputMode="adjustResize"` (matching the app.json change in 4.1),
      `keyboardBehavior="interactive"` so the sheet follows the keyboard as it animates
      rather than snapping after it, and `keyboardBlurBehavior="none"` so a stray tap
      outside the field does not dismiss a half-typed note. **[device]** to confirm.
- ☑ **4.7 Tab accessibility role.** *(2026-08-18)* `accessibilityRole="tab"`.
- ☑ **4.8 A revalidated deep link redirects away from itself.** *(2026-08-18)*
      The re-route now only fires for a launch that **started at the boot gate**. The
      pathname is captured before any await — by the time revalidation answers the gate has
      long since redirected, so "are we at `/` now" would always be false. A deep-linked
      screen keeps itself; the store is already updated, so the right tabs are underneath
      when the user navigates back. This bit hardest on exactly the links where a flag
      *had* just moved — a QR activated on another device, an invitation accepted.
- ☑ **4.9 Leaflet loads from unpkg at runtime.** *(2026-08-18)*
      Kept on the CDN — the map is useless without a network anyway, so bundling ~150 KB
      into every install to save one request on a screen already making dozens is the
      wrong trade — but now pinned with **subresource integrity**. This is third-party
      JavaScript running inside a WebView our own page hands a `postMessage` bridge to;
      without a hash, whoever controls the CDN chooses what runs beside that bridge. The
      two hashes were **computed from the real 1.9.4 files**, not recalled. A mismatch
      fails to the existing empty-map state rather than to running something unverified.
      Changing the version means changing the hashes in the same edit — a stale hash looks
      exactly like an offline device.

## 5. Screen-by-screen UI pass

Every tab screen and modal, checked against its web counterpart in `apps/web` — same
sections, labels, copy and judgement calls, **optimised for one thumb on a phone**:
larger touch targets, sheets instead of dropdowns, fewer columns, no hover-only
affordances. Mockup layout, never mockup colours — the theme is green.

**The screens already exist and work.** This is a polish pass, not a rebuild — so the
unit of work is *one mobile screen against one web file*, and the output is either a
change or a line here saying why the web version's choice does not carry to a phone.
Do not restructure a screen that is already right.

### How to work one screen

1. Read the web component (mapped below), then the mobile screen.
2. List what the web shows that the mobile does not, and vice versa.
3. For each difference decide: **port it**, or **record why not** (no endpoint, no room
   on a phone, hover-only, desktop-density table). Both are acceptable outcomes; a
   silent omission is not.
4. Apply, then `mobile:typecheck && mobile:lint && mobile:test`, then tick.

### The shared kit this pass introduced (2026-08-18)

Three pieces landed before the first screen, because every screen wanted them:

- **`lib/responsive.ts` + `components/ui/layout.tsx`** — *fit the handset*, not
  web breakpoints. A 320dp phone is 28% narrower than a 430dp one, so a tile row
  hardcoded to four columns truncates its labels on the small end and leaves a
  hole on the large one. `<Grid>` measures the width it was **given** (so it is
  right inside a sheet, a card or a full screen), `columnsThatFit` picks the
  count from a minimum cell width, and `cellWidth` floors the division — rounding
  overflows by a fraction of a pixel and wraps the last cell onto its own line on
  exactly one screen width. 21 tests. Also `<InfoTile>`, `<StatTile>`, `<Chip>`
  and `<FactRow>` — the mockups' card grammar, once, so two screens cannot end up
  with different versions of the same tile.
- **Global asset viewer** (`lib/asset-viewer.ts`, `components/asset-viewer.tsx`,
  mounted at the root). Tap any asset anywhere and it opens full-screen: pinch
  and double-tap zoom, swipe-down to dismiss, paging across the whole gallery, a
  save/share action, and the private-vs-public source decision made **once**
  (`viewerSourceFor`, 17 tests) rather than at each call site — a public R2 URL
  that gets an `Authorization` header is rejected outright, and that branch was
  one copy-paste away from happening. Wired into complaint attachments (which had
  a fixed-height sheet with no zoom), food photos, community media (which left
  for the OS browser), the hostel gallery and the payment QR.
- **Upload progress in the notification shade** (`lib/upload-notification.ts`,
  `lib/upload-notifier.ts`). The web's universal uploader ported the rest of the
  way: the toaster covers the app, this covers the case it cannot — someone
  photographs a rent receipt and switches to their banking app. One notification
  per **batch**, not per file; the percentage floors to 5% so a transfer costs
  ~20 reposts instead of one per network chunk; the finished summary is built
  from a running tally because the queue prunes a succeeded row after 2.5s. It
  **never asks for permission** (§4.5) — it reads it, and stays silent without
  it. 26 tests. Foregrounded, it goes to the shade list only: the handler in
  `push-notifications.ts` now excludes it from the banner path, or it would slide
  over the screen twenty times a file on top of the toaster saying the same thing.

### Rules that already caught things once

- **Screens show data, not marketing.** The mobile home already had hero copy, trust
  tiles and a stats band cut once (M6, second pass). Do not port them back.
- **Never offer a control the server cannot honour.** The filter sheet takes one
  facility and one room type because that is what `publicHostelListQuerySchema` accepts;
  Settings had no notification toggles until the model existed. A dead control is worse
  than a missing one.
- **Mockups are blue; the theme is green.** Copy the layout, never the palette.
- **Every `useResource` loader stays memoised** — since §1.2 an unmemoised inline arrow
  fetches in a loop.

- ☑ **5.1 Resident** — home, payments, food, notices, more *(2026-08-18)*
      **Home.** Ported from the web: the hostel contact card (phone and email as
      tap-to-call/mail chips), notice **previews** (the rows showed a category
      where the web shows two lines of the body), and **QuestionCall**, which
      existed on the web for students and was absent from mobile entirely — new
      `openQuestionCall()`, opened in an in-app browser so the back gesture
      returns to the app. New metric strip (notices / complaints / night status)
      replaces the full-width night-status card; `feeStatus.unpaidCount` was in
      the payload and drawn nowhere, and now qualifies the amount ("across 2
      unpaid invoices").
      **Ordering differs from the web deliberately: the money leads.** The web
      opens on a full-width hostel photo. A resident opens this app to pay rent or
      read a notice and already knows which building they live in, so the photo is
      a 64dp thumbnail beside the contact chips (tappable into the asset viewer)
      and the outstanding balance is the first thing on the screen.
      **Not ported: the web's "Unread notices" metric and its "New" badge.**
      `serializeNotice` on the dashboard emits no `isRead` at all, so `!isRead` is
      true for every row and the web marks all of them new. The tile counts
      **urgent** instead, which is a field the serializer does emit.
      **Payments.** The web rebuilt this page around "what do I owe and how do I
      pay it" and the screen had not followed — it opened on a total and six
      identical-looking rows. Added the **focus card** (oldest open month, its
      reference code with copy-to-clipboard, and both actions: paying was two taps
      into a detail screen), the **metric strip** (next due / last paid / settled),
      and an **Open/Settled/All** filter as chips rather than the web's tab bar.
      New `paymentStats` and `filterInvoices` in `invoice-ledger.ts` (+10 tests) —
      `nextDue` is the **oldest** open month, not the first row: the list arrives
      newest-first, so taking the head pointed a resident who is two months behind
      at August while July aged into a default.
      **Food.** Meal cards now match the dashboard and the web (soft icon square,
      timing as a badge). The photo grid moved to `<Grid>` — three fixed 104dp
      tiles plus gaps need 328dp and a 320dp phone has ~280, so the third wrapped
      and left a hole — and now shows the **caption**, which the server stores and
      the web displays. Photos open in the asset viewer. Fixed: this was the only
      `uploadAsset` call in the app with no `label`, so the toaster and the new
      shade notification both said "Uploading file".
      *Recorded difference:* the web's upload form takes an optional caption;
      mobile shares in one tap and sends none. Captions from the web still render.
      **Notices.** The web filters by status (All/Unread/Urgent with counts) and
      this screen filtered by category; both now share one chip scroller, because
      two chip rows is one too many on a phone. Ported the web's icon square
      (megaphone / alert), which is what makes a list of ten scannable. Fixed
      along the way: the screen fetched page 1 and dropped `pagination.hasMore`,
      so older notices were unreachable on the phone — there is now a "Load older
      notices" button, hidden while a filter is applied since the filter runs over
      what has been fetched.
      **More.** Now uses the shared `<Avatar>` rather than a local initial circle,
      and the hostel block became contact chips. Fixed stale copy: the
      Notifications row still read "and why you cannot pick yet", which stopped
      being true when §3.2 shipped.
      Verified: typecheck, lint, **557 tests / 41 files**, `expo export` bundles.
      Rendering and gestures are **[device]** — the viewer's pinch/drag and the
      upload notification cannot be exercised from here.
- ☑ **5.2 Guardian** — home, payments, safety, more *(2026-08-18)*
      The screens were already the more careful of the two: they had cut the web's
      **"Make a Payment"** button (no guardian payment route exists anywhere in
      `apps/web`, so it did nothing) and its **"Emergency Status: Normal"** tile
      (the payload has no SOS field, so it printed "Normal" whether or not an
      alert was live). Both stay cut.
      Ported: the web's **metric row** on Home, gated the same way every section
      is — the tiles are *collected* rather than rendered with `null` holes, so a
      guardian who shared only night status gets one tile filling the row instead
      of one tile and two gaps. **"Paid" is new to mobile**: new
      `guardianPaidAmount` (+4 tests) sums `paidAmount`, **not** `PAID` rows — a
      `PARTIAL` month has real money against it — and returns `null` rather than
      zero when finances are not shared, because a confident "NPR 0 paid" states
      something about the ward this app has no basis for. It also joins the
      payments summary card.
      Today's meals now use the same block the resident screens use, so a parent
      and their child are looking at the same thing.
      **One contact card, not the web's two.** The web has "Warden / Hostel
      In-charge" and "Hostel Emergency Contact" and both render the *same*
      `hostel.contact.phone` — there is no warden field in the payload. Two cards
      offering one number reads as two escalation routes and is one. The single
      card gained the address and email the payload already carried, which is what
      a parent wants at the moment their child is not answering.
      Verified: typecheck, lint, 561 tests.
- ☑ **5.3 Cook** — home, menu, photos, more *(2026-08-18)*
      The cook screens were already built for their case — wet hands, in a hurry,
      one-handed — so this was a legibility pass, not a rebuild. The four announce
      cards gained the meal icon square: a cook picks the card by shape before
      reading a word of it, and four cards distinguished only by a heading is the
      version that gets breakfast announced at dinner. The weekly routine now uses
      the same meal block the residents see, because the kitchen reading a
      different rendering of the menu from the people eating it is how "the app
      said chicken" starts.
      **Extracted `components/meal-row.tsx`** while doing it. Four screens show a
      meal — resident home, resident food, guardian home, cook menu — and they
      showed it three different ways: a truncated `<ListRow>`, an icon beside a
      heading, and a row with the timing as trailing text. Same dinner, different
      thing depending on who was looking. Now one component: icon square, timing
      as a badge (it is the second thing anyone looks for, and trailing muted text
      is where it goes to be missed), items on two lines.
      **Recorded, not built:** the cook cannot see their own photos. `/cook/food-
      photos` is POST-only — no route lists what a kitchen has uploaded — so
      residents see the photos and the cook who took them cannot. Appended to §7
      rather than faked from the announcement log, which carries no photo ids.
      Verified: typecheck, lint, 561 tests.
- ☑ **5.4 Provider** — home, card, more *(2026-08-18)*
      **The rows stay rows.** The web draws each job as a full card — title,
      hostel, description, category, location, schedule, phone. Eight of those is
      two jobs per screenful on a phone, and the detail screen already carries the
      description and the call button, which is the tap the web card exists to
      save and a phone does not need saving. Recorded rather than ported.
      What the rows *did* lack was the trade: every row looked identical, so a
      provider scanning for their own work read every title. New
      `jobCategoryIcon` maps all eleven `maintenanceCategorySchema` values (+ a
      fallback tool for one the server adds later, which is the case that
      otherwise renders blank and looks like a broken build). New metric strip —
      open / urgent / done — via `urgentJobCount` and `completedJobCount`; urgent
      counts **open** HIGH and URGENT only, because a completed emergency is a
      record, not something to look at today. +5 tests.
      `card.tsx` unchanged: its status tag already carries the distinction that
      matters (`PENDING_APPROVAL` explains an empty Jobs tab that would otherwise
      look like a bug), and it deliberately does not re-render the platform ID
      card that `app/id-card/` owns.
      Verified: typecheck, lint, 566 tests.
- ☑ **5.5 Admin-lite** — home, residents, alerts, more *(2026-08-18)*
      **The biggest find in this section was on Alerts: `evidenceAssetId` has been
      on the claim payload all along and the screen never showed it.** Approving a
      payment claim is the one action here that moves money, and it was the only
      one an admin had to take on trust. There is now a "View proof" button that
      opens the receipt in the global viewer — it zooms, which matters because the
      amount on a bank screenshot is small and the whole question is whether it
      matches.
      Overview: occupancy and listing reach became tile rows (three figures that
      mean something *together* read badly as a stack of label/value rows, which
      is read one at a time). **"Needs attention" stays rows** — those are a queue
      where each item is a destination, and a tile with a number on it is a worse
      tap target than a row with a label and a chevron. Occupancy still shows "—"
      with "Configure rooms" rather than 0% when `capacitySummary` is missing.
      Residents: a face per row via `<Avatar>`, whose colour is derived from the
      name — which is what makes two adjacent rows of a forty-person roster tell
      themselves apart at a glance. This needed a small `left` slot on `<ListRow>`
      (takes precedence over `icon`, never renders beside it: two leading columns
      and no clear subject).
      The rest of the web dashboard — fee schedules, billing runs, reconciliation,
      warden management, room config, nine report views — stays in the browser,
      which is what the More tab already says.
      Verified: typecheck, lint, 566 tests.
- ☑ **5.6 Public / browse** — home, hostels, search, compare, profile *(2026-08-18)*
      **A real paging bug on the hostel gallery.** The photos were a hardcoded
      `width: 400` inside a `pagingEnabled` ScrollView, and paging snaps to the
      **viewport**, not to the child — so on a 393dp phone every swipe left a 7dp
      sliver of the next photo and drifted further out of alignment with each
      page, and on a 430dp phone it stopped 30dp short. It looked right only on a
      device exactly 400dp wide. Now `useWindowDimensions`, which follows a
      rotation for free. Added the mockup's **thumbnail strip** under the hero
      (twelve photos behind a swipe is twelve swipes to find the bathroom) — it
      drives the carousel rather than opening the viewer, so browsing in place
      still works.
      **Two rows on the browse profile were lying.** "Saved hostels" toasted "it
      lands in the next release" while `lib/saved-hostels.ts` was already storing
      them and Home was already rendering the row — it now shows the count and
      says they are device-local, which is the part worth knowing before you build
      a shortlist. "Notifications" and "Privacy" did the same, and `/settings` has
      held real preferences since §3.2; its routes take `requireApiPrincipal`, so
      a browsing account could always reach them. `soon()` survives for
      **Inquiries** alone, which genuinely has no endpoint.
      Fit fixes on the public home: the four type tiles were `flex-1` in a row —
      about 72dp each on a 320dp screen, where "Co-living" truncates — and
      "Browse by facility" was `w-[47%]`, percentage arithmetic that has to stay
      under half once the gap is counted. Both now measure. Hostel detail's price
      tiles too: "NPR 10,000 – NPR 18,000" in a third of a 320dp screen was
      truncating to "NPR 10,0…".
      **Recorded, not ported:** the mockup's facility tiles carry a sub-label
      ("High Speed" under Wi-Fi, "24/7 Security" under CCTV) drawn from nothing —
      `facilities` is a `string[]`. Chips stay. Same for the mockup's third fee
      tile: `pricing` has no security deposit, and two tiles that are true beat
      three that look complete.
      Verified: typecheck, lint, 566 tests.
- ☑ **5.7 Shared modals and sheets** — filter panel, select, confirm sheets, SOS
      overlay, upload toaster *(2026-08-18)*
      Most of this section was already right and §4.6 had just been through the
      keyboard behaviour, so the pass was a review with one real fix.
      **The SOS countdown circle now grows with the text inside it.** It was a
      fixed 144dp holding `text-6xl`, which is fine at the default font scale and
      clips at the accessibility settings people actually use — Android reaches
      2.0× and a two-digit countdown at 1.3× already overflows. `scaledHeight`
      caps the growth at 1.3 rather than following it all the way: past that the
      circle pushes Cancel off a short screen, and on this screen of all screens
      Cancel must stay reachable. First use of the font-scale half of
      `lib/responsive.ts`.
      Reviewed and left alone, with the reasons: the **filter panel** keeps
      "Clear all" in its header and one primary button in the footer rather than
      the mockup's Reset/Apply pair — a header action plus one primary is the
      phone idiom, and the panel's single-select `Choice` pills already match what
      `publicHostelListQuerySchema` accepts. The **`Sheet`** keyboard modes,
      insets and dynamic sizing are §4.6's and unchanged. The **upload toaster**
      now has the shade notification as its sibling rather than a replacement:
      the toaster is the primary readout while the app is open, and the
      notification covers the case it cannot.
      Verified: typecheck, lint, 566 tests, `expo export` bundles.

## 6. Device pass — [device], after everything above

- ☐ 6.1 M0: runs on a physical Android device over LAN
- ☐ 6.2 M2: five session/boot acceptance tests
- ☐ 6.3 M3: three resident acceptance tests
- ☐ 6.4 M4: five notification acceptance tests
- ☐ 6.5 M6: three discovery acceptance tests
- ☐ 6.6 M7: all four role groups on hardware

## 7. Found along the way

Anything discovered while working the list above, appended here rather than fixed inline.

- ☐ **7.1 `/inquiry` with no `?hostel=` lands on "Hostel unavailable".**
      `public-inquiry-page.tsx` defaults `hostelSlug` to the literal
      `"green-view-hostel"`, a mockup slug that does not exist in the database — the
      request 404s and the page renders its error state. Seen while verifying 2.2; it is
      **pre-existing**, not caused by that change. Every real link carries `?hostel=`, so
      this only bites someone who types `/inquiry` directly, but the honest fix is either
      to redirect to `/hostels` or to ask which hostel.
- ☑ **7.3 A kitchen can see its own food photos.** *(2026-08-18)*
      `/cook/food-photos` was POST-only, so a cook could post a photo of dinner and
      had no way to see it — or to see whether anyone had posted at all today —
      while every resident in the hostel could.
      **Server:** new `GET` on the same route and the same role list
      (`COOK`/`HOSTEL_ADMIN`/`WARDEN`, scoped by `resolveCookHostelId`, so it is
      not a door into another kitchen), plus `listCookFoodPhotos` in
      `cook.service.ts` and a pure `food-photo-days.ts` (+12 tests).
      **Grouped by day in `Asia/Kathmandu`, not UTC** — Nepal is +05:45, so a
      breakfast photographed at 05:30 local is `23:45Z` the *previous* day. Group
      by UTC and the kitchen sees yesterday's breakfast filed under the day
      before, one row out, only ever for the early meals: the kind of wrong nobody
      reports and everybody stops trusting. Doing it on the phone would have handed
      the same decision to the handset's timezone. Each day carries
      **`mealsCovered`**, distinct meals out of four — four photos of dinner is not
      the same as one of each, and a photo count cannot tell those apart.
      **`source: KITCHEN | RESIDENT`, not an uploader id.** The cook login is
      shared kitchen-wide, so `uploadedBy` is the same user for every cook in the
      building and cannot answer "who posted this". Kitchen-or-resident is the
      distinction that is both true and useful.
      **Verified against the running API with a minted COOK token** (never a typed
      password): 200 with 22 photos over 2 days for *Education Light Hostel*,
      `mealsCovered` per day, `source: KITCHEN`; a RESIDENT token gets **403
      FORBIDDEN**; unauthenticated gets **401**.
      **Mobile:** `(cook)/photos.tsx` now shows a day-grouped grid — date, meals
      covered, photo count, and each tile captioned with its meal and the clock
      time it went up — tapping into the global asset viewer scoped to **that
      day**. Refreshes itself after a successful post, so the cook sees the photo
      they just took. Its own `useResource`, so a failing announcement log does not
      take the photos down with it.
      Verified: mobile typecheck/lint/566 tests, web lint/**1805 tests**,
      `expo export` bundles.
- ☐ **7.2 `.next/types/validator.ts` fails `tsc --noEmit` in `apps/web`.**
      Generated route-type errors about `(hostel-admin)` layouts whose `params` are typed
      `Promise<{ hostelSlug: string }>` against Next 16's `LayoutProps`. Pre-existing and
      unrelated to any work here — `src/` itself is clean — but it means
      `npm run typecheck --workspace web` is red by default, which trains people to ignore
      it. Worth either fixing the layout signatures or excluding `.next` from the check.
- ☐ **7.4 The global map: debounced search, result list, and live turn-by-turn.**
      Its own work order at [`MAP_NAV_PLAN.md`](MAP_NAV_PLAN.md) — read that, not this line.
      Three faults the owner reported on `/map`: search had no debounce and no result list,
      a result could not be tapped to move the map, and Directions drew a static line with no
      way to follow it. Sections A–E are done and ticked there: debounced search with a
      tappable result list; fine location requested for navigation only; OSRM `steps=true`
      with a tested `lib/navigation.ts` (heading fusion, off-route, arrival, instruction text);
      a CSS-rotated heading-up map with counter-rotated pins and a direction arrow; and
      `use-guidance.ts` driving a Start/NavCard/Stop flow with rationed rerouting.
      typecheck, lint and **656 tests / 45 files** green, `expo export` bundles.
      **Open: the two device passes (F.3, F.4)** — the search-and-tap check, and a walk
      outside with fine location after a rebuild. The rebuild is required: `app.json` now
      asks for `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` instead of blocking it.
- ☐ **7.5 The same map on the website.**
      Work order at [`WEB_MAP_PLAN.md`](WEB_MAP_PLAN.md) — read that, not this line. Ports §7.4's
      map to `apps/web`: a global `/map` reachable from the header, Google-Maps-like layout
      (floating search, side panel, controls bottom-right, bottom sheet under `md`), debounced
      search with a clickable result list, directions, live turn-by-turn, compass, the three tile
      styles and the pin name label. Not started.

## 9. The hostel detail screen — owner report of 2026-08-19

- ☑ **9.1 Centre the name, and put Share where a share button goes.** *(2026-08-19)*
      `AppBar` gained `centerTitle`: three columns with the outer two pinned to a
      fixed `SIDE_SLOT` (40dp) so they cancel and the title lands on the optical
      centre. **Not** an absolutely-positioned title — that is what React
      Navigation does, and it lets a long name run underneath the back arrow,
      because an absolute child has no siblings to be constrained by. "Shanti
      Bhawan Boys Hostel & Residency" is not an unusual name. Documented as
      one-control-per-side; a second action would overflow under the title, so
      leave `centerTitle` off there.
      Share is `react-native`'s `Share.share` (the pattern `id-card`, `referrals`
      and the community card already use), building its message in the pure,
      tested `lib/hostel-share.ts`. The link is the **website's** `/hostels/{slug}`,
      not a deep link: a shared hostel lands in a WhatsApp thread where most
      people do not have the app, and on a phone that does, the verified App Links
      from §2.3 hand that same URL back to the app anyway. The name, place and
      price are repeated in the text because chat clients unfurl a link when they
      feel like it — never in an SMS. A missing price drops its line rather than
      shipping "— per month". The action only renders once there is a hostel, so
      it cannot post a blank message over a loading spinner.
- ☑ **9.2 The map, as the website's Location panel does it.** *(2026-08-19)*
      `HostelMap` gained an optional `nearby` and an optional `onSelect` rather
      than a third Leaflet page being written: `lib/leaflet.ts` exists precisely
      because an SRI hash that drifts from its version renders as a blank grey box
      that looks exactly like being offline, and two builders were already one too
      many. Nearby places draw as small neutral dots with a glyph, deliberately
      unlike the brand teardrop — the one thing a reader must never have to work
      out is which pin is the place they might live in — and carry a negative
      `zIndexOffset`, because a campus dot over a hostel *inside* that campus is
      the likeliest collision on this map. The frame is fitted to the **hostels
      only**; folding in a bus terminus 2 km out would shrink the hostel to a dot.
      `onSelect` is omitted on this screen: one pin, and "View hostel" would link
      to the screen it was tapped on.
      The flat list of eight nearest places became the web's seven groups, in the
      web's order and its labels (`lib/hostel-nearby.ts`, ported from
      `NEARBY_GROUPS`) — a pharmacy at 200 m next to a park at 210 m is trivia; a
      heading that says whether there is a campus is the answer most readers came
      for. Unknown categories from the geocoder are kept in a trailing group
      rather than dropped, so a hostel does not lose a selling point because the
      client is a version behind. A "Get directions" button goes to the existing
      `/directions/[slug]` (§7.4) rather than to Google Maps. No coordinates, no
      grey rectangle: the address stands alone with the website's own explanation.
      **Bug found and fixed while doing it:** the generated Leaflet page lives in a
      JS template literal, and a comment I put inside it contained backticks —
      which closed the template. Babel reports it at the comment, not at the
      string. There is now a NOTE at that spot saying so.
- ☑ **9.3 The food routine, in full, natively.** *(2026-08-19)*
      This screen used to say "a weekly menu is published — you'll see the full
      routine once you move in." **`/public/hostels/{slug}` already returns
      `foodRoutine`**, all 28 cells of it, and the website draws every one on this
      same page. The app was holding a menu it had already downloaded and telling
      the reader to sign a tenancy to see it, on the screen where they decide
      whether to.
      The website's 7×4 table is right for a 1200dp column and wrong for 360dp, so
      it is the resident Food tab's day strip instead — same 28 cells, same order,
      opening on today rather than asking for a sideways scroll. Rather than
      rebuild that beside the resident one, `DayStrip`, `MealCard` and the
      month-end card moved into `components/food-routine.tsx` and both screens
      render them; the rating form stayed in `(resident)/food.tsx` and is passed
      through a `mealFooter` slot, because a visitor has no dinner to rate. It had
      to be extracted as `MealFeedback` on the way, since its open/closed state is
      per card — one flag for four cards would open lunch and dinner together.
      Day is still resolved in Nepal time; the food facts stay as chips above the
      week, because "is there veg every day" is a filter and "what is Thursday's
      lunch" is a preview.
      The website's "special meals" strip is **not** ported: it re-lists every
      noted meal, and the day strip already shows each note on the day it happens.
      The month-end special is the one entry belonging to no day, so it keeps its
      card.

      **Verified:** mobile typecheck + lint clean, **737 tests / 50 files** (was
      721/48), `expo export --platform android` bundles (6.5 MB) from a clean run.
- ☑ **9.4 Three defects found after the owner reported "several bugs".** *(2026-08-19)*
      **Mine, and the worst of the three:** the Location map was a live, pannable
      Leaflet map inside `<Screen scroll>`. `HostelMap`'s own header states the
      rule — a pannable map in a vertical ScrollView puts two pan gestures on the
      same pixels — and browse obeys it by switching scrolling off for its map
      view. A fixed 220dp height does not dodge that; it makes it worse, because a
      reader scrolling past drags the map instead of the page. `HostelMap` gained
      `preview`: Leaflet's drag/zoom/tap handlers off **and**
      `pointerEvents="none"` on the WebView so no touch reaches it at all, with a
      `Pressable` over it going to `/directions/[slug]` — a screen that owns its
      gestures. Belt and braces on purpose: the first stops the page reacting, the
      second guarantees the ScrollView sees every gesture regardless.
      **Also mine:** both new registration screens drew upload previews from the
      raw URL. `POST /public/files/upload` answers with a **relative** path
      whenever R2 is unconfigured, and a phone has no origin to resolve it
      against — so the selfie and the document thumbnails were blank after uploads
      that had actually succeeded. Both now go through `absoluteMediaUrl`, which is
      the exact trap `lib/media.ts` exists to prevent.
      **Not mine, found in logcat:** `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of
      undefined (reading 'setBearing')`, thrown inside the map WebView.
      `map-explorer.tsx` claims "injection is gated on `ready`" — but the gate was
      written at each *effect's* call site, and the imperative handle is passed to
      `app/map.tsx`, which is outside that discipline and cannot see the flag. Its
      north-up effect fires `setBearing(0)` on mount, before the page has posted
      `ready`; `webview.current?.` does not help, because the WebView exists and it
      is the *page inside it* that has not run its script. The gate moved into
      `call` itself, and `sentBearing` is cleared on `ready` so a bearing recorded
      as sent while it was being dropped cannot suppress the real one. It surfaced
      only as a `chromium` line in logcat, which is how it survived this long.
      **Process note:** backticks went into a comment *inside* the generated page's
      template literal twice in one session, and Babel reports that at the comment
      rather than at the string — slow to diagnose. Both builders now carry a NOTE
      at the top of their script block, and the check is one command: slice between
      the delimiters and grep for a backtick. Also worth knowing: `expo lint` caches
      in `.expo/cache/eslint` and will keep reporting a parse error after it is
      fixed; delete that directory rather than trusting the run.

      **Open — [device]:** the map is a WebView and the share sheet is the OS's;
      neither can be exercised from here. Worth checking on the phone that the
      place dots are legible at 16dp and that the centred title truncates rather
      than collides on a long hostel name.

## 8. Partner & programme screens — owner report of 2026-08-19

Reported from the device against `/register-hostel`, `/service-providers`,
`/offer-program` and the Profile tab's "Your search" group.

- ☑ **8.1 Action first, then the reading.** *(2026-08-19)*
      `DocumentScreen` gained an `action` slot rendered **under the masthead**, above
      every word of copy, with a hairline under it (`InfoActions`). All three partner
      screens moved their block from `extra` (which sits after the sections) into it.
      **No copy was cut** — the owner's configured text is the owner's text, and an
      app showing two thirds of a page the website shows in full is a second, worse
      version of that page. What changed is its shape: `InfoSections` now folds, first
      open, so nine sections are nine tappable headings rather than ~2,000 words you
      scroll past to learn what the headings are; and `InfoIntro` is a padded, tinted
      lede with the first paragraph open and a Read more. Section bodies gained `pr-2`
      — a bullet ending flush with the screen gutter reads as clipped.
      The action renders **above the can't-load states too**: a registration button
      does not stop working because the platform has not shipped its page copy.
- ☑ **8.2 Register your hostel, natively.** *(2026-08-19)*
      `app/register-hostel/apply.tsx` — five steps (Basics, Location, Rooms,
      Documents, Review) over a pure `lib/hostel-registration.ts` that owns the field
      list, the per-step validation and the payload. Typed from
      `publicHostelApplicationCreateSchema`, **not** from the web component, which
      sends four keys Zod strips before the service sees them.
      The old handoff reason — "ownership documents live on a computer" — was wrong
      about which computer. A Nepali owner's citizenship certificate is a card in a
      drawer, and the device pointed at it is this one. So the ID is **photographed**,
      and the required rules document is generated from the platform's own three
      templates via `uploadPublicText` (the applicant edits the words first; it
      uploads as real `text/plain`). Neither requirement was relaxed — one reviewer
      reviews both clients' applications.
      Uploads go through the new `lib/public-uploads.ts` → `POST /public/files/upload`,
      **not** the presign pipeline: `/files/presign` needs a principal and scopes the
      row to a hostel, and an applicant owns neither. `lib/public-upload-limits.ts`
      applies the route's own 5 MB / five-type rule **before** the bytes move, because
      refusing a 9 MB photo after uploading 9 MB is a minute of someone's life.
      Not ported: the localStorage draft, the VAT calculator, the portals sidebar, and
      six optional document slots — the platform can request any of those afterwards
      through `requestedDocuments`, which already exists.
      The landing screen now also answers "what happened to mine?" from
      `/public/hostel-applications/my-applications`, which is why the application is
      filed through the **authenticated** client even though the route tolerates
      anonymous.
- ☑ **8.3 Become a service provider, natively — plus a live selfie step.** *(2026-08-19)*
      `app/service-providers/apply.tsx`, five steps over `lib/provider-registration.ts`.
      The handoff reason here was the Google gate — which exists to attach the
      application to a verified account, and **the app already has one**: the session
      was established at launch and `registerServiceProvider` posts through the
      authenticated client, so `requireApiPrincipal` gets the same `userId` the web
      flow works to produce. The upgrade path is unchanged; the app arrives already
      through the gate.
      **The selfie is step 4 and the camera is the only source.** Approval publishes
      this person in a directory and issues an ID card a resident is shown at their
      door before letting a stranger in; a gallery pick can be any image on the
      internet. Submitted as `PROFILE_PHOTO` — not the more descriptive `SELFIE` —
      because the reviewer's page looks up exactly that string, and a better name
      would file the photo where their screen cannot see it. It is also **first** in
      the documents array, so the 8-item cap drops a supporting file, never the face.
      `categories` preserves tap order: the first is the headline trade.
      The landing screen recognises all four states, and the third is the one a
      two-state check gets wrong — an application *under review* must not be offered
      "Apply" (the server 409s it) but must not be told "you're done" either.
- ☑ **8.4 Saved hostels gets its own screen.** *(2026-08-19)*
      `app/saved.tsx` — a full-width vertical list, every entry visible, each
      removable where it sits. The row used to push `/(browse)`: tapping "Saved
      hostels" and landing at the top of a discovery feed, shortlist in a carousel
      three screenfuls down, reads as a broken link. Home's horizontal row stays —
      that is a *glance* inside a browsing screen; this is the list.
      Renders from the stored snapshots, so it is complete offline and survives a
      hostel dropping out of the server's first-60 window; pull-to-refresh folds
      newer prices in through `sync`, and a failed fetch is **not** an error state
      because nothing on screen came from it. Deliberately not `<HostelCard>`: a
      snapshot has no rating or vacancy, and `saved-hostels.ts` explains why — a
      stale "2 beds free" is a lie where a stale price is merely old.
      **The others:** Notifications and Privacy & your data both pushed plain
      `/settings` — two subtitles promising two things, one screen delivering
      whichever was scrolled to, and someone hunting "delete my account" landing on a
      theme picker. `/settings?section=` now draws only the half asked for. A
      parameter rather than three route files because all three share every hook;
      splitting them would be three screens fetching the same deletion status. An
      unknown value falls through to the whole screen, so the More tabs' plain
      `/settings` link and any push deep link are unaffected.
      Inquiries stays a "coming" toast: `/public/inquiries` is a POST and nothing
      lists what you sent, so a dedicated screen would be a permanent empty state.

      **Verified across 8.1–8.4:** mobile typecheck + lint clean, **721 tests / 48
      files** (was 656/45), `expo export --platform android` bundles (6.5 MB). Web
      lint clean, `tsc --noEmit` clean, **1826 tests / 128 files**.
      The payload builders are checked against the **real Zod schemas** by
      `apps/web/src/modules/hostels/mobile-registration-contract.test.ts` — it lives
      in `apps/web` because that is where the schemas are, and a mobile-side test
      could only assert against a hand-copied description of the contract, which is
      the exact failure this repo keeps hitting. It imports two mobile modules that
      have **no imports at all** (which is why they are pure value modules), so
      nothing pulls React Native into the web run.
      **Open — [device]:** the camera steps. Neither the selfie nor the ID photograph
      can be exercised from here, and nor can a real multipart upload to
      `/public/files/upload`. The next device pass should file one provider
      application end to end and watch the portrait land on the platform review page.

## 10. Admin tabs — the five main services (owner decision 2026-08-19)

The admin group shipped as `Overview / Alerts / Residents / More`, which is one
dashboard, one inbox, one list and a drawer — not a map of the product. The two
things an owner opens a phone for, **money** and **the day's operations**, had no
tab at all: claims were buried inside Alerts and food, roll call and notices were
web links on More.

**The five, mirroring `portal-nav.ts`'s own admin groups** (Dashboard · Residents ·
Finance · Operations · Growth & System):

| Tab | Route | Portal group it stands for |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `(admin)/index` | Dashboard |
| Residents | `(admin)/residents` | Residents |
| Community | `(admin)/community` | — (platform-wide, every role) |
| Money | `(admin)/money` | Finance |
| More | `(admin)/more` | Growth & System |

**Community is compulsory in every signed-in role and always third** (owner,
2026-08-19). One platform-wide conversation, not six role-shaped copies, and the
public bar has always had it dead centre — so the tab does not move when someone
signs in. That cost the admin bar a slot: **Today** gave it up and is now a route
reached from Home, and Money took Today's place. Resident gave up **Notices** the
same way. Guardian, cook and provider had room and simply gained it.

**Alerts stops being a tab.** Its four sources each move next to their own domain —
claims to Money, complaints and maintenance to Today, inquiries to Residents, SOS
to a banner on Home — and the catch-all becomes the **notification bell**, the same
`/notifications` screen the public app already gives every signed-in user
(`notifyAdminsOfClaim` and the SOS fan-out already write to it, so the feed is real,
not aspirational). The combined queue survives as a non-tab route for "show me
everything that needs a decision".

- ☑ **10.1 One queue for the group, and badges off it.** *(2026-08-19)*
      Not the redux slice the plan called for — a **provider**. `AdminAlertsProvider`
      in `(admin)/_layout.tsx` holds one `getAdminAlerts()` for every admin screen, and
      `useAdminAlerts()` hands each tab its own slice. Four screens each fetching would
      have been sixteen requests for the same four lists, and a badge that was only
      right on the tab you were already looking at. `TabDef.badge` feeds `tabBarBadge`,
      but the count is **drawn by `AnimatedTabBar` itself** — `tabBarBadge` is rendered
      by React Navigation's own bar, and this app does not use it. Same 9+ cap as the
      header bell. Money badges claims, Residents inquiries, Today complaints; **SOS
      deliberately has no badge** — it is a banner on Home, and a "1" on a tab is far
      too quiet for it.
- ☑ **10.2 The bell, on every admin screen.** *(2026-08-19)*
      `IconButton` moved out of `discovery-header.tsx` into `components/ui/`, and the
      new `NotificationBell` wraps it. The public home's hand-rolled bell now uses it
      too, which **fixed it in passing**: it had no `topics`, so the unread count only
      moved on refocus. `/notifications` was already role-agnostic
      (`principal.userId`, no role branch) and `notifyAdminsOfClaim` plus the SOS
      fan-out already write to it, so an admin's feed was real and simply unreachable
      without leaving their tabs.
- ☑ **10.3 Money tab.** *(2026-08-19)*
      `finance/invoices` (the matrix: totals + one row per resident, billed or not) over
      the claims queue moved out of Alerts with approve / reject / view-proof intact.
      Row logic lives in `lib/admin-money.ts` (+9 tests) rather than in the screen: it
      keeps `NOT_BILLED` **in** the outstanding list — the obvious "has an unpaid
      invoice" filter hides the worst case, a resident nobody billed, which has no due
      date and therefore nothing chasing it — clamps `amountOwed` at zero so an
      overpayment does not render as a negative debt, and breaks sort ties on the name
      so the list does not reshuffle under a thumb on every refresh. `NOT_BILLED` was
      added to `lib/status.ts` as **warning**, not neutral.
      Tapping a row calls them; there is no admin resident screen on mobile and
      editing an invoice is a portal job.
- ☑ **10.4 Today — built as a tab, now a route.** *(2026-08-19)*
      Roll call, complaints, maintenance, food, notices. Two writes, both phone-shaped:
      **override a night status** (`PATCH …/night-status/{id}/override`, reason
      required 3–1000 and recorded against the account — it writes over what a resident
      said about themselves) and **publish a notice** (title + message + urgent only;
      scheduling, expiry and audience are desk decisions). The override list is not
      `NIGHT_STATUS_OPTIONS` — that one excludes `NOT_VERIFIED` because a *resident*
      cannot un-say something, and an admin undoing a mistaken entry is the whole point
      of the override route. `SOS_TRIGGERED` is in neither: writing it would show an
      active emergency with nobody alerted.
      Each of the four sources is loaded tolerantly — `viewNightStatus`, `manageFood`,
      `manageNotices` and `manageMaintenance` are four separate warden grants, so one
      403 must not blank the other three sections.
- ☑ **10.5 Residents tab gains its leads.** *(2026-08-19)*
      Inquiries sit **above** the roster, tap-to-call. In the old feed they ranked below
      overdue complaints — a lead that decays in hours waiting behind a queue that runs
      in days.
- ☑ **10.6 Home.** *(2026-08-19)*
      Unacknowledged SOS pinned above the money with its acknowledge button in place,
      and "Needs attention" rewired to the live queues. **This fixed two wrong numbers:**
      `report.complaints` is `ComplaintModel.countDocuments(scoped)` — every complaint
      the hostel has *ever* had — and `report.maintenanceRequests` is every non-deleted
      request in any status. Both sat under a heading reading "What is open right now".
      The rows now read `useAdminAlerts().counts`, which is the same data the badges and
      the destination tabs show, and each row opens the tab that owns it.
- ☑ **10.7 Retire the Alerts tab.** *(2026-08-19)*
      `RoleTabs` learned `hidden`, which renders `href: null`. That was not enough on its
      own: expo-router implements `href: null` as `tabBarItemStyle.display = "none"` plus
      a null `tabBarButton`, both of which its **default** bar honours and
      `AnimatedTabBar` had never read — so the route would have appeared as an
      unlabelled sixth tab. The bar now skips them (flattened, since the option is a
      `StyleProp`). `alerts.tsx` keeps its place in the group so the tab bar survives the
      drill-down, reads the shared provider instead of fetching, and is retitled **Action
      queue** — what is still undecided, as against the bell's record of what was sent.
      `/(admin)/money` and `/(admin)/today` were added to the push allow-list so a
      notification about money lands where it can be acted on.
- ☑ **10.8 Community in every role, third slot.** *(2026-08-19)*
      A `community.tsx` in all five signed-in groups, each `<CommunityBoard insideTabs />`
      over the component the public tab already uses. One glyph everywhere —
      `chatbubbles`, not `people`, which collided with Residents inside the admin bar.
      Three screens became non-tab routes in the process (`(admin)/today`,
      `(admin)/alerts`, `(resident)/notices`); each gained an explicit `onBack` to its
      group's Home rather than `router.back()`, because a bottom-tab navigator's
      default `backBehavior` is `firstRoute`, not `history`, so plain back would be
      right only by accident of tab order. Home gained a **Today** row as that
      screen's front door.

      **Verified:** mobile typecheck clean, lint clean, **745 tests / 51 files**
      (was 737/50), `expo export --platform android` bundles (6.5 MB).
      **Open — [device]:** the tab bar itself. Whether the hidden route really is absent
      from the bar, whether the badge sits right against a 23dp icon, and whether the
      two new sheets clear the keyboard are all things an emulator screenshot answers
      and a bundler does not.

## 11. Critique pass on the admin screens *(2026-08-20)*

A hierarchy / density / composition review of the five admin surfaces, run against
the `critique-visual-hierarchy`, `critique-information-density` and
`critique-composition` rubrics. Ordered worst first: the two that change what the
app *can do*, then the four that change what it looks like it can do.

The rule this pass works under was corrected on the day it started: the app owes
the web **feature parity**, not a copy of its layout. Every web feature must exist
here; how it looks is a phone problem to be solved for the phone.

- ☑ **11.1 Community moderation, missing entirely.** *(2026-08-20)*
      The admin Community tab was `<CommunityBoard insideTabs />` and nothing else — the
      member view of a space its owner is responsible for policing — while the portal has
      carried `community-moderation-panel.tsx` since Community shipped. Now: a badged
      shield in the bar opening `(admin)/community-reports`, with the **Reported / Taken
      down / All** queue, both verdicts and the staff announcement.
      Four routes, read off the service rather than the panel's hand-written type:
      `GET /hostel-admin/community?filter=`, `PATCH …/{id}/hide`, `DELETE …/{id}/hide`
      and `POST /hostel-admin/community`. The last two are worth naming — **`DELETE` is
      one endpoint doing two jobs.** It clears the flag, clears the hidden marks, sets
      the post visible and dismisses its open reports, so on a flagged post it means
      "this is fine" and on a hidden one it means "restore". Same write; the label is
      computed from `status` because saying *restore* over a post that was never hidden
      is nonsense.
      **`serializePost` returns `media` and the web panel's type drops it**, so the portal
      moderates reported photographs by their caption. The mobile cards render the
      thumbnails, tappable into the existing asset viewer.
      A reason is required both ways (3–500, server-enforced) and is checked before the
      sheet closes. Reason text is *not* shown to the author — it is for the audit entry
      the service writes, which is why the sheet asks instead of sending a canned string.
      Gate is `requireHostelStaffPrincipal`, so wardens moderate too; no per-capability
      flag is involved. `useReportedCount` is tolerant anyway and returns **null** on a
      failed read, which hides the shield — as distinct from **0**, which shows it
      unbadged, because "cannot reach the queue" and "the queue is empty" must not look
      the same.
      **Verified:** typecheck clean, lint clean, **800 tests / 53 files**,
      `expo export --platform android` bundles (6.6 MB).
- ☑ **11.2 Today is buried, and reachable four ways from Home.** *(2026-08-20)*
      **Owner's call: keep the five tabs and fix what is inside them.** Today stays a
      route — the slot question was put to the owner with three options and this was the
      answer, so the Community decision recorded in `(admin)/_layout.tsx` stands.
      What went is the duplication. Home had four paths to Today: the `Roll call`
      shortcut on the fold, the `Late complaints` row, the bare `Today` row, and
      `Tonight → Open roll call`. The last is gone; the Tonight card is chips only now,
      which is what its own header ("Who is accounted for") already promised. Three
      remain and each means something different — the *job*, the *queue*, the *screen* —
      which is the distinction the fourth blurred.
      Not every card has to be a tap target. This one is an answer, not a question.
- ☑ **11.3 Home renders the same figure three times.** *(2026-08-20)*
      `alerts.counts.claim` was drawn by the Payments quick-action badge, the "Payments
      to check" row and the **Money tab badge** — and the first and third are on screen
      simultaneously, about forty points apart. Same for `inquiry` across Residents.
      Separately, the hero's `BannerFacts` printed "This month" and "Still to collect"
      directly above the Money section, whose entire subject is those two numbers.
      The rule now: **the tab bar owns counts, the hero owns the lifetime total, the
      Money section owns the month.** Quick-action badges are gone (they are shortcuts —
      their job is to be reachable, not to report), and `BannerFacts` with them. That
      left `BannerFacts` with no callers, so it came out of `admin-shared.tsx`; its
      fixed-half-width lesson is kept as a note there and the surviving instance of the
      pattern lives on `AdminMoneyCard`.
      `ui-preview.tsx` carries its own copy of Home and was updated in step — it is a
      design-review screen, so a stale one is worse than none.
- ☑ **11.4 Page views outweighs everything it sits above.** *(2026-08-20)*
      `publicViewsLast30Days` was `text-2xl`: the second-largest number on Home behind
      the hero's lifetime total, outweighing every queue count, the collection meter and
      the roll call. It is the least actionable figure on the screen.
      All three listing figures are `text-base` in one three-up row now, and the
      live/draft state moved to the section header's `action` slot — where Money already
      puts its Chasing/Settled badge, so the two sections finally read as siblings.
- ☑ **11.5 "Waiting for you" mixes queues, destinations and its own superset.** *(2026-08-20)*
      Five `AttentionRow`s in one run: three with counts, two without — and one of the
      two, "Everything that needs a decision", is a *superset* of the three above it,
      dressed as their fourth sibling. `AttentionRow`'s API already knew the difference
      ("a row that is a destination rather than a queue") but nothing on screen did.
      The three queues keep the tinted tile and the count pill. The two doors are
      `ListRow`s below a **full-width** divider — plain grey glyph, no pill — so the card
      reads as *what is waiting*, then *where else to go*. The `alerts` screen keeps its
      only front door in the process, which is why that row was moved rather than cut.
- ☑ **11.6 Money repeats the filter you are standing in, and has dead rows.** *(2026-08-20)*
      `invoiceSegment` filters `Overdue`, `Unbilled` and `Paid` on a single
      `displayStatus`, so a `StatusPill` on those rows printed the segment name back at
      the reader once per row for the length of the list. It shows in **Owing** only —
      which is the mixed one (unpaid, partial, pending proof, overdue, never billed) and
      also the default, so the pill is present exactly where it carries information.
      The dead rows were worse than they looked: calling is a row's only action, and
      `ListRow` draws its chevron *in the slot `right` occupies* — which these rows always
      pass — so a resident with no phone rendered *identically* to one with a phone and
      silently did nothing when tapped. The subtitle now says "No phone on file".
      Truthiness rather than `??` on that check, because an empty string arrives as often
      as an absent key and `onPress` already treated the two the same.
- ☑ **11.7 Today has three empty states and two paddings.** *(2026-08-20)*
      One screen, four treatments of one idea: `Card` + `EmptyState`; the same pair with
      the card's padding switched on the row count; and two sections explaining
      emptiness in loose `<Text variant="muted">` prose with no title. Two of those were
      not emptiness at all — they were **permission denials wearing an empty state's
      clothes**, which tells a warden the hostel has no open requests when what happened
      is that a box went unticked in Warden Management.
      `EmptyCard` and `PermissionCard` now live in `ui/states.tsx`. The conditional
      padding disappears rather than being parameterised: the empty branch is a
      *different component*, so nothing has to compute an inset. Cards that draw rows
      still pass `px-4 py-1`, which is a real need and not the thing that was wrong.
      Food had three outcomes told in two sentences of one `<Text>` — published, nothing
      published yet, not yours to see. They look different now.
      `(admin)/money` took the same two components for its two empty branches.
      **Verified across 11.2–11.7:** typecheck clean, lint clean, **800 tests / 53
      files**, `expo export --platform android` bundles (6.6 MB).
      **Open — [device]:** every item in this section is a *visual* judgement and none of
      it has been seen on a handset. The full-width divider inside the "Waiting for you"
      card, the hero with its facts row gone, and the three-up listing figures are the
      three most worth a screenshot.

## 12. "Manage on the web" becomes eight native screens *(2026-08-21)*

The admin **More** tab carried a section called *Manage on the web*: eight rows,
each one `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` into `/{slug}/admin/...`. The file argued
for it — "a cramped native re-implementation that can do two of its nine columns"
— and the owner overruled it on 2026-08-21, restating the rule from §11: **the
app owes the web feature parity.** A row that opens a browser is not an app
screen. Nine columns is a desktop *layout* problem, not a feature list.

So each row becomes a real screen under `app/manage/`, at the root stack rather
than inside `(admin)` — the group's file names are its tab bar, and these slide
over it like every other detail view. `lib/manage-api.ts` holds the routes, read
off the services and validation schemas rather than the portal's hand-written
types.

- ☑ **12.1 Rooms** *(2026-08-21)* — `manage/rooms`. Room types as counts, their
      rents, meal inclusion, vacancies and up to ten photos each.
      **`PATCH profile` replaces `roomConfigurations` wholesale**, recomputes
      `capacitySummary` from what it is given, and deletes any ROOM photo whose
      type is no longer present — so every mutation sends the *whole* array. A
      delta would wipe the other room types and their photographs.
      Photos upload `PUBLIC` (a private asset is readable only through the
      authorising route, so a private gallery is one only its uploader can see)
      and are stored with the **relative** URL the web sends.
- ☑ **12.2 Notices** *(2026-08-21)* — `manage/notices`. Category, audience,
      urgency, a publish date and an expiry, against Today's two-field sheet.
      Live / scheduled / expired are **computed**, not stored — two date
      comparisons — which is why a notice moves between them with nobody editing
      it. There is no DELETE route and none is faked: "Expire now" writes
      `expiresAt`, so a notice residents have read stops applying rather than
      stops having existed. A GUARDIANS-only notice sends **no push and no
      email** (`deliverNoticeBroadcast` skips the fan-out); the option says so,
      because silence is otherwise indistinguishable from a bug.
- ☑ **12.3 Food** *(2026-08-21)* — `manage/food`. The week edited a day at a
      time, meal times, the month-end special and the cook portal.
      One document, one `PUT`, so the screen holds a **draft** and the Save bar
      appears only when it differs from what loaded. A meal with no items is
      *omitted* rather than sent empty — the schema requires at least one item —
      which is also how a meal is cleared.
      The portal's "Special Foods" tab is not missing: it is a view of the meals
      carrying a note, and on a phone the note is already on the card.
      The cook's name is saved only while the portal is **on** — `updateCookPortal`
      branches on `enabled` and its disabled path never writes `cookName`, so a
      Save button there would report success and change nothing.
- ☑ **12.4 Maintenance** *(2026-08-21)* — `manage/maintenance`. The queue, its
      five statuses with a note and a cost note, the internal/provider comment
      split, and the approved-provider directory with its phone numbers.
      Raising one is **a sentence**: `lib/maintenance-suggest.ts` (a copy of the
      web's `maintenance-role-suggest.ts`, kept in step deliberately) reads the
      title, the category, the priority and the trade to call out of what the
      admin types. 11 tests.
      No reassign screen, because there is no reassign route:
      `maintenanceStatusUpdateSchema` has no `providerId`. The list already
      returns `comments` and `history` inline, so opening a request costs nothing
      — do not add a detail fetch.
- ☑ **12.5 Reports** *(2026-08-21)* — `manage/reports`. Money / Operations /
      Growth over one `reports/overview` call plus the two windowed analytics
      panels; the four CSV exports go out through the OS share sheet
      (`downloadAndShareCsv`), since a phone has no download tray.
      The web's bar chart is a scrolling strip of `View`s — twelve pairs of bars
      is a layout problem, and every RN chart package brings SVG or a native
      module to solve it. The seven-column ledger table becomes six rows; the
      whole thing is what the export is for.
      Attendance says **when** and never **where**: the analytics are built from
      zone rows because each ping's coordinates are discarded as it lands.
- ☑ **12.6 Settings** *(2026-08-21)* — `manage/settings`, `manage/wardens`,
      `manage/referrals`. Profile, gallery, location (a search box, not a map —
      `profile/geocode` resolves a pasted `maps.app.goo.gl` link, which a client
      cannot follow itself), facilities, rules, pricing, the community and
      attendance switches, and the locked-field change request.
      Wardens carry the sixteen capability flags with the **three money powers**
      — reverse, fee schedule, payment profile — marked and off by default; they
      were split out of one `verifyPayments` flag that let a new warden rewrite
      any payment on their first day. An unknown key such as the retired
      `verifyPayments` is **kept and sent back**, because an edit form that
      dropped it would strip a live warden's access the first time somebody
      changed their name.
- ☑ **12.7 Residents** *(2026-08-21)* — `manage/resident/new`,
      `manage/resident/[id]`, plus the roster tab rewired to reach them.
      Intake, details, status, activation codes, both checklists, guardians and
      their logins, emergency contacts, and the fee override. Inquiries got their
      status and follow-up note on the roster tab, where they already are.
      Three things the screens say out loud because getting them wrong is silent:
      a **room-type change moves a bed** and fails if the destination is full;
      **move-out does not free the bed** — the status does, so the sheet writes
      both; and the fee override is cleared with **`null`, not `0`**, because
      zero is a deliberate free stay that `resolveMonthlyCharge` honours.
      The activation code's plaintext exists **once**, in the issuing response.
      `(admin)/residents.tsx`'s "no edit affordances" paragraph is gone: every one
      of those actions is something a person does standing in the building.
- ☑ **12.8 Finance** *(2026-08-21)* — `manage/finance`, `manage/statements`, plus
      cash and void on the Money tab's rows.
      Rate cards (never edited — a new one closes the old the day before it
      starts, so an old invoice stays explainable), the billing run (**no amount
      field**: an unpriced resident *fails* rather than being billed a fallback),
      the payment profile, the three gateways with write-only secrets, and
      statement reconciliation.
      Reconciliation is the one worth reading: its **approved-but-never-arrived**
      bucket is where fraud surfaces, about a week late, and it names the
      approving warden as well as the resident. `expo-document-picker` was added
      for the CSV/XLSX upload — the only new dependency in §12, and it is
      **required lazily**. It is native code and `android/` is checked in, so a
      top-level import of it throws at module load on any dev client built before
      it existed; expo-router reports that as "Route is missing the required
      default export" and the entire screen dies — including the reconciliation
      work, which is plain HTTP and needs no native code at all. The require sits
      inside the handler, and the screen says up front when this build cannot
      open a file browser. Seen on a device 2026-08-21, fixed the same day.
      Taking cash moved onto the phone because that is where it happens: the
      amount is the only number the caller supplies, alongside who physically
      took it and which paper slip it is on (also the idempotency key).

**Verified across 12.1–12.8:** mobile typecheck clean, lint clean, **824 tests /
55 files** (was 800/53), `expo export --platform android` bundles (6.9 MB, was
6.6). `lib/web-portal.ts` now has no callers and its header says why.
- ☑ **12.9 The `(browse)` layout warning, found on the same device run.**
      *(2026-08-21)*
      `Layout children must be of type Screen, all other children are ignored.
      Update Layout Route at: "app/(browse)/_layout"` on every launch. Not from
      §12 — `RoleTabs` grew `{hidden?.map(...)}` during §11 — but it fires only
      for the one group that passes no `hidden`, which is `(browse)`.
      The optional-chaining form renders `undefined` as a child, and **React does
      not drop those the way everyone assumes**: `mapIntoArray` converts
      `undefined` to `null` and then runs the callback anyway
      (`if (null === children) invokeCallback = true`, verified in
      `react.development.js`). expo-router's `useFilterScreenChildren` gets that
      null, sees it is not a `Screen`, and warns. `?? []` iterates zero times and
      says nothing. The reasoning is written at the call site because the naive
      reading of it is wrong and would be re-introduced otherwise.

**Open — [device]:** first run on a handset found two things, both fixed above:
statement importing needs a rebuilt binary
(`npx expo run:android`), and until then that one button is disabled rather than
the screen being dead. Still unseen: the Rooms photo strip, the reconciliation
sheet's four segments, and the resident record — the longest sheet stack in the
app.

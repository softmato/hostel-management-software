/**
 * Money actually received against a `SubscriptionInvoice`.
 *
 * Append-only, like `PaymentEvent` one level down. Nothing here is ever edited
 * to reflect a later payment — a second instalment is a second row, and what
 * the hostel still owes is the invoice amount minus the sum of the settled rows
 * pointing at it. That is the whole reason the invoice carries no `paidAmount`.
 *
 * ## Three methods, and only one of them is on a rail
 *
 * `SOFTMATO` is money taken through the parent company's checkout — eSewa,
 * Khalti, whatever they route it to. It lands in their ledger, gets their
 * invoice number and their receipt, and we learn it happened from a signed
 * webhook. Nothing about it is asserted by a browser.
 *
 * `CASH` is the agent taking notes in the field and typing in what they took.
 * It is **deliberately off-rail**: there is no way to represent physical cash
 * on a payment API, and inventing a transaction for it would put a row in
 * somebody's ledger that no gateway can corroborate. So a cash row is our own
 * record, honest about being one — it carries no Softmato transaction number
 * and its receipt is ours, not theirs.
 *
 * Cash is the one that needs the audit trail, because it is the one where the
 * money passes through a person: `collectedBy` is required on it, so every
 * rupee collected in the field is attributable to the member of staff who put
 * their hand out for it. The team roster reads exactly this field to answer
 * "who collected how much".
 *
 * `MANUAL` is the owner scanning the platform's own collection QR from their
 * phone, paying out of their banking app, and sending back a screenshot. It is
 * the **fallback lane** while the Softmato rail is not carrying owner-initiated
 * payments, and it stays after the rail lands: there will always be an owner
 * whose bank app worked and whose checkout did not. Nothing about it is
 * asserted by a gateway, so the only thing that can turn it into money received
 * is a human on the platform side looking at the proof — which is what
 * `IN_REVIEW` below exists to represent.
 *
 * ## `PENDING` and `IN_REVIEW` are both real states, and they are not the same
 *
 * A QR payment on the rail is displayed and then waited on. Until the gateway
 * confirms, the row exists and is worth nothing — it must not count toward the
 * balance. That is `PENDING`, and what clears it is a webhook.
 *
 * `IN_REVIEW` is a `MANUAL` row whose payer has attached proof and is waiting on
 * a person. It is worth exactly as little: only `SETTLED` rows are ever summed,
 * so a claim cannot publish a hostel or shorten a due on the strength of a
 * screenshot. The distinction matters because the two are cleared by different
 * things and a platform admin's review queue is *only* the second kind — a
 * `PENDING` row in it would be an abandoned checkout somebody is being asked to
 * adjudicate.

/**
 * Proof that money was received (target §4.4).
 *
 * **One receipt per settled `PaymentEvent`**, not one per month. The old rule —
 * one per `Payment`, amended in place every time more money arrived — meant a
 * resident who paid in two instalments held a document that had silently changed
 * since they downloaded it, and there was no record of what it used to say.
 *
 * A receipt is therefore **immutable**. A wrong one is voided and reissued, and
 * both stay readable: the void carries a reason and the reissue points back at
 * what it replaced. That is what makes a receipt evidence rather than a view.
 *
 * `paymentId` and `month` are the legacy fields, kept nullable through the
 * expand phase so the old approval path keeps working until 2.8 deletes it
 * (ADR-8). New receipts set `eventId` and `invoiceId`.

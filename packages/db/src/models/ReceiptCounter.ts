 * An atomic per-hostel, per-period receipt sequence (target §4.4).

 * which is a race dressed as a query: it works only because of five-digit
 * zero-padding, breaks at 100,000 receipts in a month, and two concurrent
 * approvals read the same "last" number (current §5.5).
 *
 * A single `findOneAndUpdate($inc)` with `upsert` is atomic in MongoDB, so
 * concurrent callers get distinct numbers with no retry loop and no lock.
 *
 * **Per hostel, not global.** Global numbering interleaves one hostel's receipts
 * with another's, and the gaps leak the platform's total monthly volume to any
 * hostel that looks at its own sequence.

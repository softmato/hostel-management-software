 * Sent when a superadmin invites somebody onto the platform admin roster.
 *
 * No password is minted and none is sent — the sibling `credentialsIssued`
 * mail does that, for the older path where the account is created up front.
 * Here the link *is* the credential: opening it proves the mailbox is theirs,
 * which is the whole reason a platform role may be granted through it, and the
 * recipient signs in with Google on the same address afterwards.
 *
 * The grade being granted is named in the subject and again in the body,
 * because "you have been made a superadmin" and "you have been made a
 * moderator" are very different messages to receive and the recipient should
 * not have to accept one to find out which it was.

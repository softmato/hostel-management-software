 * How this resident signs in, which is the one thing the mail cannot guess.

 * `EXISTING_ACCOUNT` — the intake found an account that already belongs to them
 * and promoted it, so their password or Google sign-in is unchanged and there is
 * nothing to activate.
 *
 * `ACTIVATION_CODE` — nobody could be linked: registered phone-only, or with an
 * address that belongs to no account. Residents are **never** sent credentials
 * (`linkResidentAccount`), so the honest sentence is that the hostel will hand
 * them a code, not a promise of a login that does not exist.

/**
 * The confirmation a resident gets the moment a hostel registers them.
 *
 * ## Why this exists alongside `residentLinkedEmail`
 *
 * That one is sent only when an account was found and promoted, and it is about
 * the *portal*: sign in as you always did. So a resident registered at the desk
 * with no platform account — which is most of them, on the day they arrive —
 * received nothing at all. They had just handed over a deposit and an admission
 * fee and been given a bed, and the product's entire record of it was a row on
 * somebody else's screen.
 *
 * This is the record of the arrangement: which hostel, which room, from when,
 * what the rent is, what was charged today and what they owe for their first
 * month. It is the thing a resident goes looking for in three weeks when they
 * cannot remember what they agreed to, and the thing they can forward to whoever
 * is paying for them.
 *
 * ## Every figure is optional and every one is dropped rather than guessed
 *
 * A hostel that charges no admission fee, takes no deposit, or has not priced
 * the room type yet is a real hostel, not an error. A line that said
 * "Admission fee: NPR 0" over the first is worse than no line, and one that
 * printed a rent nobody has set would be a claim about money that is false.

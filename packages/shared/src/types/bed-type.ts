/**
 * Bed type — the canonical vocabulary for what a resident is renting
 * (target §3.1).
 *
 * **This is not a replacement for `roomType`.** `Resident.roomType` is free text
 * and is the key that hostel capacity accounting matches on by string equality
 * (`hostel-capacity.service.ts`), and the label ~15 screens render. Changing it
 * is a separate project. `bedType` is additive and derived: required on invoices
 * and fee schedules, displayed in finance UI, and authoritative for *pricing*
 * only (plan §3.2, D1).
 *
 * Defined here rather than in the finance module because billing, room
 * configuration and public listings all need the same five words. A private copy
 * inside `modules/finance` is how two vocabularies start disagreeing.
